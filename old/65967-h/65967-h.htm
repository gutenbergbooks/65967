<hr />

<p>History, until a recent period, was mainly a record of gigantic
crimes and their consequent miseries. The dazzling
glow of its narrations lighted never the path of the peaceful
Husbandman, as his noiseless, incessant exertions transformed
the howling wilderness into a blooming and fruitful garden, but
gleamed and danced on the armor of the Warrior as he rode
forth to devastate and destroy. One year of his labors sufficed
to undo what the former had patiently achieved through centuries;
and the campaign was duly chronicled while the labors
it blighted were left to oblivion. The written annals of a nation
trace vividly the course of its corruption and downfall, but
are silent or meagre with regard to the ultimate causes of its
growth and eminence. The long periods of peace and prosperity
in which the Useful Arts were elaborated or perfected are
passed over with the bare remark that they afford little of interest
to the reader, when in fact their true history, could it now
be written, would prove of the deepest and most substantial
value. The world might well afford to lose all record of a hundred
ancient battles or sieges if it could thereby regain the
knowledge of one lost art, and even the Pyramids bequeathed
to us by Egypt in her glory would be well exchanged for a few
of her humble workshops and manufactories, as they stood in
the days of the Pharaohs. Of the true history of mankind
only a few chapters have yet been written, and now, when the
deficiencies of that we have are beginning to be realized, we find
that the materials for supplying them have in good part perished
in the lapse of time, or been trampled recklessly beneath the
hoof of the war-horse.</p>

<p>In the following pages, an effort has been made to restore a
portion of this history, so far as the meagre and careless traces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
scattered through the Literature of Antiquity will allow.&mdash;Of
the many beneficent achievements of inventive genius, those
which more immediately minister to the personal convenience
and comfort of mankind seem to assert a natural pre-eminence.
Among the first under this head may be classed the invention
of Weaving, with its collateral branches of Spinning, Netting,
Sewing, Felting, and Dyeing. An account of the origin and
progress of this family of domestic arts can hardly fail to interest
the intelligent reader, while it would seem to have a special
claim on the attention of those engaged in the prosecution or
improvement of these arts. This work is intended to subserve
the ends here indicated. In the present age, when the resources
of Science and of Intellect have so largely pressed into
the service of Mechanical Invention, especially with reference to
the production of fabrics from fibrous substances, it is somewhat
remarkable that no methodical treatise on this topic has been
offered to the public, and that the topic itself seems to have almost
eluded the investigations of the learned. With the exception
of Mr. Yates’s erudite production, “<i>Textrinum Antiquorum</i>,”
we possess no competent work on the subject; and
valuable as is this production for its authority and profound research,
it is yet, for various reasons, of comparative inutility to
the general reader.</p>

<p>That a topic of such interest deserved elucidation will not be
denied when it is remembered that, apart from the question of
the direct influence these important arts have ever exerted upon
the civilization and social condition of communities, in various
ages of the world, there are other and scarcely inferior considerations
to the student, involved in their bearing upon the true
understanding of history, sacred and profane. To supply,
therefore, an important desideratum in classical archæology, by
thus seeking the better to illustrate the true social state of the
ancients, thereby affording a commentary on their commerce
and progress in domestic arts, is one of the leading objects contemplated
by the present work. In addition to this, our better
acquaintance with the actual condition of these arts in early
times will tend, in many instances, to confirm the historic accuracy
and elucidate the idiom of many portions of Holy Writ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span></p>

<p>How many of the grandest discoveries in the scientific world
owe their existence to accident! and how many more of the
boasted creations of human skill have proved to be but restorations
of lost or forgotten arts! How much also is still being
revealed to us by the monumental records of the old world,
whose occult glyphs, till recently, defied the most persevering
efforts of the learned for their solution!</p>

<p>To be told that the Egyptians, four thousand years ago,
were cunning artificers in many of the pursuits which constitute
lucrative branches of our modern industry, might surprise
some readers: yet we learn from undoubted authorities that
such they were. They also were acquainted with the fabrication
of crapes, transparent tissues, cotton, silk, and paper, as
well as the art of preparing colors which still continue to defy
the corrosions of defacing time.</p>

<p>If the <i>spider</i> may be regarded as the earliest practical
weaver upon record&mdash;the generic name <i>Textoriæ</i>, supplying
the root from which is clearly derived the English terms, <i>texture</i>
and <i>textile</i>, as applied to woven fabrics, of whatever materials
they may be composed&mdash;the <i>wasp</i> may claim the honor of
having been the first paper-manufacturer, for he presents us
with a most undoubted specimen of clear white pasteboard, of
so smooth a surface as to admit of being written upon with
ease and legibility. Would the superlative wisdom of man but
deign, with microscopic gaze, to study the ingenious movements
of the insect tribe more minutely, it would not be easy
to estimate how much might thereby be achieved for human
science, philosophy, and even morals!</p>

<p>For those who love to add to their fund of general knowledge,
especially in the department of natural history, the author
trusts that much valuable and interesting information will be
found comprised in those pages of this work which delineate
the habits of the Silk-Worm, the Sheep, the Goat, the Camel,
the Beaver, &amp;c.; while another department, being devoted to
the history of the Pastoral Life of the Ancients, will naturally
enlist the sympathies of such as take a deeper interest in the
records of ages and nations long since passed away. From a
mass of heterogeneous, though highly valuable materials, it has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
been the design of the author to select, arrange, and conserve
all that was apposite to his subject and of intrinsic value.
Thus has he endeavored to render the piles of antiquity, to
adopt the words of a recent writer, well compacted&mdash;a process
which has been begun in our times, and with such eminent success
that even the men of the present age may live to see many
of the thousand and one folios of the ancients handed over
without a sigh to the trunk-maker.</p>

<p>The ample domains of Learning are fast being submitted to
fresh irrigation and renewed culture,&mdash;the exclusiveness of the
cloister has given place to an unrestricted distribution of the intellectual
wealth of all times. What civilization has accomplished
in the physical is also being achieved in the mental
world. The sterile and inaccessible wilderness is transformed
into the well-tilled garden, abounding in luxurious fruits and
fragrant flowers. It is the golden age of knowledge&mdash;its Paradise
Regained. The ponderous works of the olden time have
been displaced by the condensing process of modern literature;
yielding us their spirit and essence, without the heavy,
obscuring folds of their former verbal drapery. We want
real and substantial knowledge; but we are a labor-saving and
a time-economizing people,&mdash;it must therefore be obtained by
the most compendious processes. Except those with whom
learning is the business of life, we are too generally ignorant
of the mighty mysteries which Nature has heaped around our
path; ignorant, too, of many of the discoveries of science and
philosophy, in ancient as well as modern times. To meet the
exigencies of our day, a judgment in the selection and condensation
of works designed for popular use is demanded&mdash;a facility
like that of the alchymist, extracting from the crude ores
of antiquity the fine gold of true knowledge.</p>

<p>The plan of this work naturally divides itself into four departments.
The first division is devoted to the consideration of
<i>Silk</i>, its early history and cultivation in China and various
other parts of the world; illustrated by copious citations from
ancient writers: From among whom to instance Homer, we
learn that embroidery and tapestry were prominent arts with
the Thebans, that poet deriving many of his pictures of domestic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
life from the paintings which have been found to ornament their
palaces. Thus it is evident that some of the proudest attainments
of art in our own day date their origin from a period coeval
at least with the Iliad. Again we find that the use of the
distaff and spindle, referred to in the Sacred Scriptures, was almost
as well understood in Egypt as it now is in India; while
the factory system, so far from being a modern invention, was
in full operation, and conducted under patrician influence, some
three thousand years ago. The Arabians also, even so far back
as five centuries subsequent to the deluge, were, it is stated on
credible authority, skilled in fabricating silken textures; while,
at a period scarcely less remote, we possess irrefragable testimony
in favor of their knowledge of paper made from cotton
rags. The inhabitants of Phœnicia and Tyre were, it appears,
the first acquainted with the process of dyeing: the Tyrian
purple, so often noticed by writers, being of so gorgeous a hue
as to baffle description. The Persians were also prodigal in
their indulgence in vestments of gold, embroidery and silk: the
memorable army of Darius affording an instance of sumptuous
magnificence in this respect. An example might also be given
of the extravagance of the Romans in the third century, in the
fact of a pound of silk being estimated literally by its weight
in gold. The nuptial robes of Maria, wife of Honorius, which
were discovered in her coffin at Rome in 1544, on being burnt,
yielded 36 pounds of pure gold! In the work here presented,
much interesting as well as valuable information is given under
this section, respecting the cultivation and manufacture of Silk
in China, Greece and other countries.</p>

<p>The second division of the work, comprising the history of the
<i>Sheep</i>, <i>Goat</i>, <i>Camel</i>, and <i>Beaver</i>, it is hoped will also be
found curious and valuable. The ancient history of the <i>Cotton</i>
manufacture follows&mdash;a topic that has enlisted the pens of
many writers, though their essays, with two or three exceptions,
merit little notice. The subsequent pages embody many new
and important facts, connected with its early history and progress,
derived from sources inaccessible to the general reader.
The fourth and last division, embracing the history of the <i>Linen</i>
manufacture, includes notices of <i>Hemp</i>, <i>Flax</i>, <i>Asbestos</i>, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
This department again affords a fruitful theme for the curious,
and one that will be deemed, perhaps, not the least attractive
of the volume. Completing the design of the work, will be
found the Appendices, comprising rare and valuable extracts,
derived from unquestionable authorities.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Ten Illustrations</i> herewith presented, five are entirely
original. It is hoped that these, at least, will be deemed
worthy the attention of the scholar as well as of the general
reader, and that their value will not be limited by their utility
as elucidations of the text. Among these, especial notice is requested
to the engraving of the Chinese Loom, a reduced fac-simile,
copied by permission from a magnificent Chinese production,
recently obtained from the Celestial Empire, and now in
the possession of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions in
this city. Another, equally worthy of notice, represents an
Egyptian weaving factory, with the processes of Spinning and
Winding; also a reduced fac-simile, copied from <i>Champollion’s</i>
great work on Egypt. The Spider, magnified with his web,
and the Indian Loom, it is presumed, will not fail to attract attention.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire work, the most diligent care has been
used in the collation of the numerous authorities cited, as well
as a rigid regard paid to their veracity. As a work so elaborate
in its character would necessarily have to depend, to a considerable
extent, for its facts and illustrations, upon the labors of
previous writers, the author deems no apology necessary in thus
publicly and gratefully avowing his indebtedness to the several
authors cited in order at the foot of his pages; but he would
especially mention the eminent name of Mr. Yates, to the fruits
of whose labors the present production owes much of its novelty,
attractiveness, and intrinsic value.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Whether silk is ever mentioned in the Old Testament
cannot perhaps be determined.</p>

<p>In Ezek. xvi. 10 and 13, “silk” is used in the common
English bible for משי, which occurs no where except here,
but which, as appears from the context, certainly meant some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
valuable article of female dress. Le Clerc and Rosenmüller
translate it “serico;” Cocceius, Schindler, Buxtorf, in their
Lexicons, and Dr. John Taylor in his Concordance, give the
same interpretation. Augusti and De Wette in their German
translation make it signify “<i>a silken veil</i>.” Others give different
interpretations. The only ground, on which silk of
any kind is supposed to be meant, is that in the Alexandrine
or Septuagint version משי is translated τρίχαπτον, and τρίχαπτον
is explained by Hesychius to mean “the <i>silken</i> web fitted to
be placed over the hair of the head” (τὸ βομβύκινον ὕφασμα ὑπὲρ τῶν
τριχῶν τῆς κεφαλῆς ἁπτόμενον), and that other ancient Greek lexicographers
also suppose a silken garment to be meant.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But the
meaning of τρίχαπτον is in reality as obscure as that of משי.
Jerome could not discover it, and concluded that the word was
invented by the Greek translator. It is now extant no where
else except in a passage of the comic Pherecrates preserved in
Athenæus. Schneider, followed by Passow, supposes it to
mean some garment made of hair, and quotes to this effect
the explanation of Pollux (2. 24.), πλέγμα ἐκ τριχῶν. Although,
therefore, the term in question may possibly have denoted
some elegant and costly ornament for the head, made at least
partly of silk, yet this opinion appears to rest altogether upon
the assumption, first, that the ancient lexicographers are accurate
in their use of the epithet βομβύκινον, and secondly, that
the Alexandrine version is accurate in adopting the word
 τρίχαπτον.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> See Schleusner, Lexicon in LXX., v.
Τρίχαπτον.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Isaiah xix. 9, according to King James’s Translators
and Bishop Lowth, mention is made of those “<i>that work in
fine flax</i>,” in the original עבדי פשתים שריקות. Rosenmüller
adopts nearly the same interpretation, which is founded
upon the use of the verb שרק or סרק in the Chaldee and
Syriac dialects to denote the operation of <i>combing</i> flax, wool,
hair, and other substances. In this sense the word has been
taken by the author of the Alexandrine Version, τοὺς ἐργαζομένους
τὸ λίνον τὸ σχιστὸν; by Symmachus, who instead of σχιστὸν uses
 κτενιστὸν; and by Jerome, “qui operabantur linum <i>pectentes</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>In the Targum of Jonathan and in the Syriac Version the
same root is taken to denote silk; רסריקין פלחי כתנא Targ. ܥܒܕܝ ܟܬܢܐ ܕܣܪܩܝܢ
Syr. Both of these seem to admit
of the following literal translation, “<i>those who make silken
tunics</i>,” or in Latin, “<i>Factores tunicarum e sericis</i>.”</p>

<p>Kimchi supposes שריקות to mean silk webs, observing
that silk is called אל שרק by the Arabs. The same opinion
has been adopted by Nicholas Fuller<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, Buxtorf, and other
modern critics. Kennicott, however, arranges the words in
two lines as follows,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><big>ובשו עבדי פשתים</big></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><big>שריקות וארגים הורי</big></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  </div>

<p>According to this arrangement, which seems most suitable to
the rules of grammatical construction, we have three co-ordinate
phrases in the plural number, denoting three different
classes of artificers. The second, שריקות, would by its termination
denote <i>female</i> artificers, viz. women employed in
<i>combing</i> wool, flax, or other substances. On the whole we
are inclined to adopt this explanation of the word, as it appears
to be attended with the least difficulty, either grammatical
or etymological.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Miscellanea Sacra, l. ii. c. 11.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Silk is mentioned Prov. xxxi. 22. in King James’s Translation,
i. e. the common English version, and in the margin
of Gen. xli. 42. But the use of the word is quite unauthorized.</p>

<p>After a full examination of the whole question Braunius<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
decides that there is no mention of silk in the whole of the
Old Testament, and that it was unknown to the Hebrews in
ancient times.</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt,” says Professor Hurwitz, “that
manufactures and the arts must have attained a high degree
of perfection at the time when Moses wrote; and that many
of them were known long before that period, we have the evidence
of Scripture. It is true that inventions were at first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
few, and their progress very slow, but they were suited to the
then condition and circumstances of man, as is evident even
in the art of clothing. Placed in the salubrious and mild air
of paradise, our first parents could hardly want any other covering
than what decency required. Accordingly we find that
the first and only article of dress was the חגורה  <i>chagora</i>, the
belt, (not aprons, as in the established version). The materials
of which it was made were fig leaves; (Gen. iii. 7.) the
same tree that afforded them food and shelter, furnished them
likewise with materials for covering their bodies. But when
in consequence of their transgressions they were to be ejected
from their blissful abode, and forced to dwell in less favourable
regions, a more substantial covering became necessary,
their merciful Creator made them (i. e. inspired them with
the thoughts of making for themselves) כתנות עור coats of
skins. (Gen. iii. 21.) The original word is כתנת <i>c’thoneth</i>,
whence the Greek χιτὼν the tunic, a close garment that was
usually worn next the skin, it reached to the knees, and had
sleeves (in after times it was made either of wool or linen.)
After man had subdued the sheep (Hebrew כבשׂ <i>caves</i> from
כגש to subdue<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>) and learned how to make use of its wool,
we find a new article of dress, namely the שמלה <i>simla</i>, an
upper garment: it consisted of a piece of cloth about six yards
long and two or three wide, in shape not unlike our blankets.
This will explain Gen. ix. 23, ‘And Shem and Japheth took
a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went
backward and covered the nakedness of their father.’ It
served as a dress by day, as a bed by night, (Exod. xxii. 26,)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
‘If thou at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou
shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down; for that
is his covering only; it is his raiment for his skin: wherein
shall he sleep?’ And sometimes burdens were carried in it,
(Exod. xii. 34,) ‘And the people took their dough before it
was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their
clothes upon their shoulders.’</p>

<p>“In the course of time various other garments came into
use, as mentioned in several other parts of Scripture. The
materials of which these garments were usually made are
specified in Leviticus xiii. 47-59, ‘The garment also that
the plague of the leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment
or a linen garment, whether it be in the <i>warp</i> or <i>woof</i>,
of linen or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything
made of skin, &amp;c.’”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> De vestitu Heb. Sacerdotum, l. 1. cap. viii. § 8.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> There is not the least shadow of truth in support of such a deduction; and
particularly so since the general tenor of the Scriptures leads to a very different
conclusion. We are, therefore, not authorized to give our support to any such
hypothesis. The history of the Sheep and Goat is so interwoven with the history
of man, that those naturalists have not reasoned correctly, who have thought it
necessary to refer the first origin of either of them to any wild stock at all. Such
view is, we imagine, more in keeping with the inferences to be drawn from Scripture
History with regard to the early domestication of the sheep. Abel, we are
told, was a keeper of sheep, and it was one of the firstlings of his flock that he
offered to the Lord, and which, proving a more acceptable sacrifice, excited the
implacable and fatal jealousy of his brother Cain. (See Part ii. pp. <a href="#Page_217">217</a> and <a href="#Page_217">293</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In our search for the distant origin of any art or science, or
in looking through the long vista of ages remote even to nations
extinct before our own, we are favored with satisfactory
evidence so long as we are accompanied with authentic records:
beyond, all is dark, obscure, tradition, fable. On such ground
it would be credulous or rash in the extreme to repeat as our
own, an affirmation, when that rests on the single testimony
of one party or interest, especially when that is of a very questionable
character. It is even safer, when history or well authenticated
records fail us, to appeal to philosophy, or to the
well known laws of mind, from which all arts and science
spring. The former favors us with the commanding evidence
of certainty and decision; and though the latter may only afford
the testimony of analogy, yet, is its probability more safe,
at least, than what rests on misguided calculations or on the
legendary tales of artifice and fiction.</p>

<p>We have, however, authentic testimony that the <i>inventive</i>
faculty existed at a very early period. The peculiar condition
of man at that time must have afforded many imperative occasions
for its exertion. Hence we read that “Jabal was the
father of such as dwell in tents” (<i>i. e.</i> <i>inventor</i> of tent-making);
that “Jubal, his brother, was the father” (inventor) of
musical instruments: such as the <i>kinnor</i>, harp, or stringed instruments,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
and the <i>ugab</i>, organ, or wind instruments; that
“Tubal-cain was the instructor of every artificer in brass and
iron, the first smith on record, or one to teach how to make
instruments and utensils out of brass and iron; and that the
sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah, whom the Targum of
Jonathan ben Uzziel affirms to have been the <i>inventrix</i> of
plaintive or elegiac poetry<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Here is then an account of the
<i>inventive</i> faculty being in exercise 3504 years before the
Christian era; or 1156 years prior to the deluge; or 804
years before the earliest period assigned to the Chinese for the
discovery of silk. And of whatever arts or sciences existing
amongst men prior to the deluge, there is no difficulty in conceiving
the possibility of the transmission of the leading and
most essential parts, at least, to the post-diluvians, by the family
of Noah.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> As a proof that the inventive faculty, as to every thing truly useful to man,
originally proceeded from <i>the only “Giver of every good and perfect gift,”</i> consult
Isa. xxviii. 24-29: and also a beautiful comment by Dr. A. Clarke on,
“And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, <i>whom I have filled</i> with
the spirit of wisdom.” Exod. xxviii. 3: and also on, “I have filled him with the
spirit of God in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner
of workmanship; to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
in brass; and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work
in all manner of curious workmanship.” Exod. xxxi. 3, 4, and 5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But instead of giving our unqualified assent to what has
been servilely copied from book to book from the most accessible
account, we shall advert to the great discrepancy relative to
Chinese chronology, amongst those who have had equal access
to their records. Thus the time of Fohi, the first emperor, has
been said to be 2951 B. C., by some 2198 B. C., and by others
2057, or about 300 years after the deluge: of Hoang-ti, 2700
B. C., by Mailla it is quoted at 2602 B. C., by Le Sage at
2597 B. C., and by Robinson and others at 1703 B. C. Similar
disagreements might, would our limits allow, be observed
concerning the rest, and particularly of the emperors, Hiao-wenti,
Chim-ti, Ming-ti, Youen-ti, Wenti, Wou-ti, and Hiao-wou-ti.
Even in more modern times, and relative to a character
so notorious as Confucius, no less than three dates are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
equally affirmed to be true. As to Hoang-ti, who is said to
have begun <i>the culture of silk</i>, we are inclined to prefer the
latter account, 1703 B. C., which makes him contemporary
with Joseph, when prime minister over the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>As a confirmation of this, it may be stated, that by referring
to the account given of nine<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the patriarchs at this period,
we shall find that the average age of human life, <i>before much
greater</i>, soon after rapidly declined. Now the average duration
of the reigns of the first three<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Chinese emperors, including
Hoang-ti, was 118 years; of the five that immediately succeeded,
only 68 years. After this, until the Christian era, the average
duration of a single reign did not exceed 23 years, and
thence until the present time not 13 years. Since, therefore,
the average duration of the reign of the first three emperors
bears an evident and fit proportion to that of the age of man
at the period specified, though not at any other before or after,
being in the former case as much too small as it would in the
latter be too great, the opinion now offered is the only one that
can be consistent with these striking facts; and, if duly considered,
presents an argument strongly corroborating this view
of the subject.</p>

<p>To attempt to establish any greater certainty, in a case of
this nature, the Chinese during the dynasty of Tschin, having,
to conceal the truth, destroyed everything authentic, would be
in vain. It would be even more rational to have recourse to
the Vedas, or sacred books of the Brahmins, or to records in
the Sanscrit, were it not a well known fact, that nearly all
ancient nations, <i>except the Jews</i>, actuated by the same ambition,
have betrayed a wish to have their origin traced as far
back as the creation. And in the gratification of this passion
none are so notoriously pre-eminent as the Egyptians, Hindoos,

The chronology relative to the early culture of silk, as
found in Chinese documents, for several irrefragable objections
already assigned, is exceedingly questionable, and therefore
we are by no means pledged to affirm that either in the
authenticity of the books, or in the correctness of the dates have
we any faith. M. Lavoisnè dates the commencement of the
Chinese dynasties at A. M.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> 1816, <i>or 159 years after the deluge</i>.
The Rev. J. Robinson of Christ Col., Cam., at A. M.
1947. We have already given as strong reasons, as under the
extreme incertitude of the case, can, perhaps, be offered, for
preferring the latter; the important points may be briefly
stated, thus:</p>

<p>
Hoang-ti was therefore contemporary with Joseph when administering
the affairs of Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But would we know what
account the Chinese themselves give relative to the earliest
introduction of the silk culture, we shall find it in the French
version of the Chinese Treatises, by M. Stanislas Julien, or in
the following words of pages 77 and 78, as translated and
published in 1838, at Washington, under the title of “Summary
of the principal Chinese Treatises upon the Culture of
the Mulberry, and the rearing of Silk-worms.”</p>

In the book on silk-worms, we read: “The lawful wife of
the emperor Hoang-ti, named <i>Si-ling-chi</i>, began the culture of
silk. It was at that time that the emperor Hoang-ti invented
the art of making garments(!).” The same fact is mentioned
more in detail in the general history of China, by P. Maillà,
in the year 2602, before our era (4447 years ago).</p>

<p>“This great prince (Hoang-ti) was desirous that Si-ling-chi,
his legitimate wife, should contribute to the happiness of
his people. He charged her to examine the silk-worms, and
to test the practicability of using the thread. Si-ling-chi had
a large quantity of these insects collected, which she fed herself,
in a place prepared for that purpose, and discovered not
only the means of raising them, but also the manner of reeling
the silk, and of employing it to make garments.”</p>

<p>“It is through gratitude for so great a benefit,” says the
history, entitled <i>Wai-ki</i>, “that posterity has deified Si-ling-chi,
and rendered her particular honors under the name of
the goddess of silk-worms.” (Memoirs on the Chinese, vol.
13, p. 240.)</p>

<p>We have seen that the most probable account relative to the
time of Fohi, said to have been the first Chinese emperor, is
that he reigned 2057 years before the Christian era, or in the
year of the world 1947. “According to the most current
opinion,” says M. Lavoisnè, “China was founded by one of
the colonies formed at the dispersion of Noah’s posterity under
the conduct of Yao, who took for his colleague Chun, afterwards
his successor. But most writers consider Fohi to have
been Noah himself(!).”</p>

<p>Now the deluge terminated A. M. 1657, and Noah lived
after the deluge 350 years<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, and therefore died A. M. 2007;
and as Fohi is said to have reigned 114 years, before Eohi
Chun or Chinun succeeded him, he was contemporary, at
least, with Noah. The ark rested on Mount Ararat, which is
generally allowed to be one of the mountains of Armenia, to
the east of the head of the Tigris. And here the same author
remarks, that “in rather less than a century and a half, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
the birth of Peleg, it is supposed that Noah, being then about
his 840th year, <i>wearied with the growing depravity of his
descendants, retired with a select company to a remote
corner of Asia, and there began what in after ages has
been termed the Chinese monarchy</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This view of the subject,
we believe, coincides perfectly with the reputable testimonies
presented by Mairan, Bailly, Guignes, and Sir William
Jones, and demonstrates that the transit of more central aborigines,
since the deluge, to the extremes of China, was perfectly
feasible,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and a matter of even high probability.</p>

<p>The first ancient author, who affords any evidence respecting
the use of silk, is Aristotle. He does not, however, appear
to have been accurately acquainted with the changes of the
silk-worm; nor does he say, that the animal was bred or the
raw material produced in Cos. He only says, “Pamphile,
daughter of Plates, is reported to have first woven it in Cos.”
(See Chapters <a href="#Chapter1_II">ii.</a> <a href="#Chapter1_III">iii.</a> and <a href="#Chapter1_IV">iv.</a> of this Part.)</p>

<p>Long before the time of Aristotle a regular trade had been
established in the interior of Asia, which brought its most
valuable productions, and especially those which were most
easily transported, to the shores opposite this flourishing island.
Nothing therefore is more likely than that the raw silk from
the interior of Asia was brought to Cos and there manufactured.
We shall see hereafter from the testimony of Procopius,
that it was in like manner brought some centuries later to be
woven in the Phœnician cities, Tyre and Berytus.</p>

<p>The arts of spinning and weaving, which rank next in importance
to agriculture, having been found among almost all
the nations of the old and new continents, even among those
little removed from barbarism, are reasonably supposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
have been invented at a very remote period of the world’s
history<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. They evidently existed in Egypt in the time of
Joseph (1700 years before the Christian era), as it is recorded
that Pharaoh “arrayed him in vestures of fine linen.” (Genesis
xli. 42.) Two centuries later, the Hebrews carried with
them on their departure from that ancient seat of civilization,
the arts of <i>spinning</i>, <i>dyeing</i>, <i>weaving</i>, and <i>embroidery</i>; for
when Moses constructed the tabernacle in the wilderness, “the
women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and
brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple,
and of scarlet, and of fine linen.” (Exod. xxxv. 25.)
They also “spun goats’ hair;” and Bezaleel and Aholiab
“worked all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the
cunning workman, and of <i>the embroiderer, in blue, and of
purple, and in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver</i>.”
These passages contain the earliest mention of woven clothing,
which was linen, the national manufacture of Egypt.
The prolific borders of the Nile furnished from the remotest
periods, as at the present time, abundance of the finest flax<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>;
and it appears, from the testimony both of sacred and profane
history, that linen continued to be almost the only kind of
clothing used in Egypt till after the Christian era<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. The
Egyptians exported their “linen yarn,” and “fine linen,” to
the kingdom of Israel, in the days of Solomon, (2 Chron. i.
16; Prov. vii. 16;) their “fine linen with broidered work,” to
Tyre, (Ezek. xxvii. 7.)</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> According to Pliny, Semiramis, the Assyrian queen, was believed to have
been the inventress of the art of weaving. Minerva is in some of the ancient
statutes represented with a distaff, to intimate that she taught men the art of spinning;
and this honor is given by the Egyptians to Isis, by the Mohammedans to
a son of Japhet, by the Chinese to the consort of their emperor Yao, and by the
Peruvians to Mamaoella, wife to Manco-Capac, their first sovereign. These
traditions serve only to carry the invaluable arts of spinning and weaving up to
an extremely remote period, long prior to that of authentic history.</p>

<p>The women of Sidon before the Trojan war, were especially
celebrated for the skill in embroidery: and Homer, who lived

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
The transition from vegetable fibre to the use of animal
staples, such as wool and hair, could not have been very difficult;
indeed, as already stated, it took place at a period of
which we possess no very authentic written record.</p>

<p>The instrument used for spinning in all countries, from the
earliest times, was the distaff and spindle. This simple apparatus
was put by the Greek mythologists into the hands of
Minerva and the Parcæ; Solomon employs upon it the industry
of the virtuous woman; to the present day the distaff is
used in India, Egypt, and other eastern countries.</p>

<p>The ancient spindle or distaff was a very simple instrument.
The late Lady Calcott informs us, that it continued
even to our own days to be used by the Hindoos in all its
primitive simplicity. “I have seen,” she says, “the rock or
distaff formed simply of the leading shoot of some young
tree, carefully peeled, it might be birch or elder, and, further
north, of fir or pine; and the spindle formed of the beautiful
shrub Euonymus, or spindle-tree.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> The superior fineness of some Indian muslins, and their quality of retaining,
longer than European fabrics, an appearance of excellence, has occasioned a belief
that the cotton wool of which they are woven is superior to any known elsewhere;
this, however, is so far from being the fact, that no cotton is to be found
in India which at all equals in quality the better kinds produced in the United
States of America. The excellence of India muslins must be wholly ascribed to
the skilfulness and patience of the workmen, as shown in the different processes
of spinning and weaving. (See <a href="#Plate_V">Plate v</a>.) Their yarn is spun upon the distaff,
and it is owing to the dexterous use of the finger and thumb in forming the
thread, and to the moisture which it thus imbibes, that its fibres are more perfectly
incorporated than they can be through the employment of any mechanical
substitutes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Spinning among the Egyptians, as among our ancestors
of no very distant age, was a domestic occupation in which
ladies of rank did not hesitate to engage. The term “spinster”
is yet applied to unmarried ladies of every rank, and
there are persons yet alive who remember to have seen the
spinning wheel an ordinary piece of furniture in domestic
economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>We are told that “Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt
and linen yarn; the king’s merchants received the linen yarn
at a price.” (1 Kings, x. 28.) And the linen of Egypt was
highly valued in Palestine, for the seducer, in Proverbs, says,
“I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, with fine linen of Egypt.” (Prov. vii. 16.) The
prophet Ezekiel also declares that the export of the textile
fabrics was an important branch of Phœnician commerce;
for in his enumeration of the articles of traffic in Tyre, he
says: “Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that
which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple
from the isles of Elisha was that which covered thee.”
(Ezek. xxvii. 7.)</p>

<p>It deserves to be remarked that the prophet here joins
Egypt with the isles of Elisha or Elis, that is, the districts of
western Greece, and thus confirms the ancient tradition recorded
by Herodotus of some Egyptian colonists having settled
in that country, which the sceptics of the German school
of history have thought proper to deny.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Spinning was
wholly a female employment; it is rather singular that we
find this work frequently performed by a large number collected
together, as if the factory system had been established
3000 years ago.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> The sceptical school of history, founded by Niebuhr, in Germany, and extended
by his disciples to a sweeping incredulity, far beyond what was contemplated
by the founder, has labored hard to prove, that the Greek system of civilization
was indigenous, and that the candid confession of Herodotus, attributing
to Egyptian colonies the first introduction of the arts of life into Hellas, was an
idle tale, or a groundless tradition. But the examination of the monuments has
proved that Greek art originated in Egypt; and that the elements of the architectural,
sculptural, and pictorial wonders which have rendered Greece and Italy
illustrious, were derived from the valley of the Nile.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>We have, however, many specimens of spinning as a domestic
employment. Indeed, attention to the spindle and
distaff forms a leading feature in king Lemuel’s description
of a virtuous woman. “Who can find a virtuous woman?
for her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her
hands. She is like the merchant’s ships; she bringeth her
food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet night, and
giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
She considereth a field, and buyeth it; with the fruit of her
hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins with
strength, and strengtheneth her arms. She perceiveth that
her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.
She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
distaff. She stretcheth out her hand to the <i>poor</i>; yea, she
reacheth forth her hands to the <i>needy</i>. She is not afraid of
the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed
with scarlet. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her
clothing is silk and purple. Her husband is known in the
gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. She
maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto
the merchant.” (Prov. xxxi. 10-24.)</p>

<p>Hamilton and Wilkinson have already shown that many
of the descriptions of combats we meet in the Iliad appear to
have been derived from the battle pieces on the walls of the
Theban palaces, which the poet himself pretty plainly intimates
that he had visited. The same observation may be
applied to most of Homer’s pictures of domestic life. We find
the lady of the mansion superintending the labors of her servants,
and using the distaff herself. Her spindle made of
some precious material, richly ornamented, her beautiful
work-basket, or rather vase, and the wool dyed of some bright
hue to render it worthy of being touched by aristocratic fingers,
remind us of the appropriate present which the Egyptian
queen, Alcandra, made to the Spartan Helen; for the
beauty of that frail fair one scarcely is less celebrated than her
skill in embroidery and every species of ornamental work.

<p>In the hieroglyphics over persons employed with the spindle
on the Egyptian monuments, it is remarkable that the word
<i>saht</i>, which in Coptic signifies to twist, constantly occurs.
The spindles were generally of wood, and in order to increase
their impetus in turning, the circular head was occasionally of
gypsum, or composition: some, however, were of a light plaited
work, made of rushes, or palm leaves, stained of various
colors, and furnished with a loop of the same materials, for
securing the twine after it was wound<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Sir Gardner Wilkinson
found one of these spindles at Thebes, with some of the
linen thread upon it, and is now in the Berlin Museum.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> The ordinary distaff does not occur in these subjects, but we may conclude
they had it. Homer mentions one of gold, given to Helen by “Alcandra the
wife of Polybus,” who lived in Egyptian Thebes.&mdash;Od. iv. 131.</p>

<p>Theocritus has given us a very striking proof of the pleasure
which the women of Miletus took in these employments;
for, when he went to visit his friend Nicias, the Milesian physician,
to whom he had previously addressed his eleventh and
thirteenth Idylls, he carried with him an ivory distaff as a
present for Theugenis, his friend’s wife. He accompanied his
gift with the following verses, which modestly commend the
matron’s industry and virtue, and, at the same time, throw an
interesting light on the domestic economy of the ladies of Miletus:</p>

The Roman and Grecian ladies displayed not less taste in
the decoration of their various spinning implements, than
those of modern times in the ornaments of their work-table.
The <i>calathus</i> or <i>qualus</i> was the basket in which the wool
was kept for the fair spinsters. It was usually made of wicker-work.
Thus Catullus in his description of the nuptials of
Peleus and Thetis, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Homer asserts that the Egyptian queen Alcandra presented
Helen with a silver work-basket as well as a golden distaff
(Odyss. iv.); and from the paintings on ancient vases, we
see that the <i>calathi</i> of ladies of rank were tastefully wrought
and richly ornamented. From the term <i>qualus</i> or <i>quasillus</i>,
equivalent to <i>calathus</i>, the Romans called the female slaves
employed in spinning <i>quasillariæ</i>.</p>

<p>The material prepared for spinning was wrapped loosely
round the distaff, the wool being previously combed, or the flax
hackled by processes not very dissimilar to those used at the
present day amongst the peasantry in the west of Ireland.
The ball thus formed on the distaff required to be arranged
with some neatness and skill, in order that the fibres should
be sufficiently loose to be drawn out by the hand of the spinner.
Ovid declares, that Arachne’s skill in this simple process
excited the wonder of the nymphs who came to see her triumphs
in the textile art, not less than the finished labors of
the loom.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft, to admire the niceness of her skill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The nymphs would quit their fountain, shade, or hill:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thither from green Tymolus they repair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leave the vineyards, their peculiar care;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thither from fair Pactolus’ golden stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drawn by her art, the curious Naids came.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor would the work, when finish’d, please so much</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As while she wrought to view each graceful touch;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or with quick motion turn’d the spindle round.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6"><i>Met</i>, vi.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The distaff was generally about three feet in length, commonly
a stick or reed, with an expansion near the top for
holding the ball. It was sometimes, as we have shown,
composed of richer materials. The distaff was usually held
under the left arm, and the fibres were drawn out from the
projecting ball, being, at the same time, spirally twisted by the
forefinger and thumb of the right hand. The thread so produced
was wound upon the spindle until the quantity was as
great as it would carry.</p>

<p>The spindle was made of some light wood, or reed, and was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
generally from eight to twelve inches in length. At the top
of it was a slit, or catch, to which the thread was fixed, so
that the weight of the spindle might carry the thread down to
the ground as fast as it was finished. Its lower extremity was
inserted into a whorl, or wheel, made of stone, metal, or some
heavy material which both served to keep it steady and to promote
its rotation. The spinner, who, as we have said before,
was usually a female, every now and then gave the spindle a
fresh gyration by a gentle touch so as to increase the twist of
the thread. Whenever the spindle reached the ground a length
was spun; the thread was then taken out of the slit, or clasp,
and wound upon the spindle; the clasp was then closed again,
and the spinning of a new thread commenced. All these circumstances
are briefly mentioned by Catullus, in a poem from
which we have already quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The loaded distaff, in the left hand placed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With spongy coils of snow-white wool was graced;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From these the right hand lengthening fibres drew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which into thread ’neath nimble fingers grew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At intervals a gentle touch was given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By which the twirling whorl was onward driven.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, when the sinking spindle reach’d the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The recent thread around its spire was wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until the clasp within its nipping cleft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Held fast the newly-finish’d length of weft.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In order to understand this description of Catullus, it is necessary
to bear in mind, that as the bobbin of each spindle
was loaded with thread, it was taken off from the whorl and
placed in a basket until there was a sufficient quantity for the
weavers to commence their operations.</p>

<p>Homer incidentally mentions the spool or spindle on which
the weft-yarn was wound, in his description of the race at the
funeral-games in honor of Patroclus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">As closely following as the running thread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spindle follows, and displays the charms</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>In India women of all castes prepare the cotton thread for
the weaver, spinning it on a piece of wire, or a very thin rod
of polished iron with a ball of clay at one end; this they turn
round with the left hand, and supply the cotton with the right;
the thread is then wound upon a stick or pole, and sold to the
merchants or weavers; for the coarser thread the women make
use of a wheel very similar to that of the Irish spinster,
though upon a smaller construction. (For further information
on the manufactures of India, their present state, &amp;c., see
<a href="#Part_THIRD">Part III</a>.)</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. C. Forster of Great Britain, has lately
published a very curious work on Arabia, being the result of
many years’ untiring research in that part of the world; from
which we learn the very interesting fact, that the ancient
Arabians were skilled in the manufacture of <i>silken textures</i>,
at as remote a period as within 500 years of the flood!</p>

<p>Mr. Forster has, it appears, succeeded in deciphering many
very remarkable inscriptions found on some ancient monuments
near Adon on the coast of Hadramant. These records, it is
said, restore to the world its earliest written language, and carry
us back to the time of Jacob, and within 500 years of the
flood.</p>

<p>The inscriptions are in three parts. The longest is of ten
lines, engraved on a smooth piece of rock forming one side of
the terrace at Hisn Ghorab. Then there are three short lines,
found on a small detached rock on the summit of the little hill.
There are also two lines found near the inscriptions, lower
down the terrace. They all relate to one transaction, an incident
in Adite history. The tribe of Ad, according to Mr.
Sale, were descended from Ad the son of Aws or Uz, the son
of Aram, the son of Shem, the son of Noah. The event recorded
is the rout and entire destruction of the sons of Ac, an
Arab tribe, by the Aws or tribe of Ad, whom they invaded. In
Mr. Forster’s book fac similes are given of the inscription; the
Aditie and the Hamyaritie alphabet; and a glossary containing
every word in them, its derivation, and its explanation; with
notes of copious illustration upon every point which they involve.
The first inscription of ten lines is thus translated:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot hanging2">

<p>We dwelt, living long luxuriously in the zananas of this spacious mansion; our
condition exempt from misfortune and adversity. Rolled in through our channel.</p>

<p>The sea, swelling against our castle with angry surge; our fountains flowed with
murmuring fall, above</p>

<p>The lofty palms; whose keepers planted dry dates in our valley date-grounds;
they sowed the arid rice.</p>

<p>We hunted the young mountain-goats and the young hares, with gins and snares;
beguiling we drew forth the fishes.</p>

<p>We walked with slow, proud gait, IN NEEDLE-WORKED, MANY-COLORED
SILK VESTMENTS, IN WHOLE SILKS, IN GRASS-GREEN
CHEQUERED ROBES<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>!</p>

<p>Over us presided kings, far removed from baseness, and stern chastisers of reprobate
and wicked men. They noted down for us according to the doctrine of
Heber,</p>

<p>Good judgments, written in books to be kept; and we proclaimed our belief in miracles,
in the <i>resurrection</i>, in the <i>return into the nostrils of the breath of life</i>.</p>

<p>Made an inroad robbers, and would do us violence; we rode forth, we and our
generous youth, with stiff and sharp-pointed spears; rushing onward.</p>

<p>Proud champions of our families and wives; fighting valiantly upon coursers with
long necks, dun-colored, iron-gray, and bright bay.</p>

<p>With our swords still wounding and piercing our adversaries, until charging home,
we conquered and crushed this refuse of mankind.</p>
</div>

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Silk is the only material used for human clothing which Mohammed, the impostor,
introduces among the luxuries of Paradise. (See the Koran, chap. 35.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the subject of these inscriptions, Mr. Forster, in the dedication
of his book to the Archbishop of Canterbury, thus remarks:
“What Job (who, living in the opposite quarter of
Arabia, amid the sands of the great Northern desert, had no
lasting material within reach on which to perpetuate his
thoughts,) so earnestly desired, stands here realized.” “Oh
that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed
in a Book! That (like the kindred creed of the lost tribe of
Ad) they were <i>graven with an iron pen, and lead, in the
rock forever</i>. (For mine is a better and brighter revelation
than theirs.) For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that
he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though,
after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in the flesh shall I
see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold,
and not another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
That the Arabians should have understood the manufacture
of silken textures at as remote a period as that supposed by Mr.
Forster, viz., 500 years after the flood, is, to say the least of it,
exceedingly questionable, yet it cannot be denied that we are
indebted to them for many useful inventions, and among which
may be mentioned the art of making <i>cotton paper</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. It is no
less true that we first received our cotton-wool from countries
where the Arabic language was spoken.</p>

<p>To the Arabs also we are indebted for that almost indispensable
article of apparel, the <i>shirt</i>, the Arabic name for which is
<i>camees</i>, whence the Italian <i>camiscia</i>, and the French <i>chemise</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>In the attempt here made to trace from the dark ages of
antiquity the progress of trades and manufactures so widely
diffused over the civilised world as those of cotton, linen, silk,
wool, &amp;c., <i>chronological order</i> is followed as closely as the
nature of the inquiry will permit.</p>

</div>

<p>The next Authors, who make mention of silk, are the Latin
poets of the Augustan age, Tibullus and Propertius, Virgil,
Horace, and Ovid. The Parthian war, and the increased intercourse
between the Roman empire and the kingdoms of the
East, had been the means of recently introducing every kind
of silken goods into more general use, although these manufactures
were still so rare as to be the objects of curiosity and admiration,
and were therefore well adapted to be brought in
among the embellishments of poetical imagery.</p>

<p>The appearance of the silken flags attached to the gilt
standards of the Parthians (Florus iii. 11.) must have been a
very striking sight for the army of Crassus, contributing both
to inflame their cupidity and to alarm them with a sense of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
power of their opponents. The conflict here referred to took
place in the year 54 B. C. In about 30 years after this date
the Roman empire obtained its greatest extension. In the language
of Petronius Arbiter (c. 119.),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Th’ insatiate Roman spread his conquering arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er land and sea, where’er heaven’s light extends.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After these words he says, that among the richest productions
of distant climates the Seres sent their “new fleeces.”
The remotest countries thus contributed to increase the luxury
of Rome, and we shall now see how silk, one of the most costly
and the most admired of its recent acquisitions, was used by its
poets to represent the polish of elevated life and to adorn their
language with rich and beautiful allusions. The webs, which
they mention, are either those still obtained from Cos, or those
imported from the country of the Seres.</p>

<h5>TIBULLUS.</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A Coan vest for girls.</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">L. ii. 6.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The latter of these two passages is remarkable as showing
that the Coan women practised the elegant art of interweaving
gold thread in their silken webs. The gold was no doubt displayed
in transverse stripes.</p>

<p>The same poet (L. iv. 8. 23.) mentions “Serica carpenta,”
chariots with silk curtains; and the following line (L. i. 14. 22.)
shows, that couches with ornamented silk covers were then in
use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Quid revelant variis Serica textilibus?</p>
</div>

<p>Propertius also mentions silk under the name of the animal,
which produced it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Shines with the produce of th’ Arabian worm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">L. ii. 3. 15.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this line, as well as in some of those before quoted, he alludes
to the use of silk by females of indifferent character. He
probably uses the epithet <i>Arabian</i>, because the Roman merchants
obtained silk from the Arabs, who received it from
Persia.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet is here enumerating the chief productions of different
countries, and therefore mentions cotton and silk. The
idea, that silk webs were manufactured from thin fleeces obtained
from trees, will be found recurring in many of the subsequent
citations. It may have been founded on reports brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
by the soldiers of Crassus, or by others who visited the interior
of Asia about the same period.</p>

<p>These passages allude to the fineness and transparency of
silken webs, which in the time of Horace were worn at Rome
only by prostitutes, or by those women who aimed at being as
attractive and luxurious as possible in their attire.</p>

<p>The former passage shows, that the silks manufactured in
Cos were dyed with the murex, “Coæ purpuræ.”</p>

<p>The expression “Sericos pulvillos” (<i>Epod.</i> 8. 15.) has been
supposed to denote small cushions covered with silk. But the
epithet “Sericos” implies nothing more than that they were obtained
from the Seres, who supplied the Romans with skins as
well as silk<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; and leather seems to have been a more proper
substance than silk for making cushions.</p>

<p>We now proceed to the testimonies of authors who wrote
either in Greek or Latin at the latter part of the Augustan age,
or immediately after it.</p>

<h5>DYONISIUS PERIEGETES.</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>It is worthy of observation that Dyonisius speaks expressly
not only of the fineness of the thread, but of the <i>flowered texture</i>
of the silk.</p>

<h5>STRABO.</h5>

<p>This is repeated by Eustathius on Dyonisius Periegetes<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.
The account seems to have been taken by Strabo, perhaps inaccurately,
from Nearchus. It is doubtful, whether Σηρικὰ denoted
silken webs in this passage. But whatever Strabo meant,
he supposed the raw material to be scraped from the bark of
trees<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>As contemporary with the authors last quoted, Dyonisius and
Strabo, we may here mention the law passed by the Roman
Senate early in the reign of Tiberius, “Ne vestis Serica viros
fœdaret.” <i>Taciti Annales</i>, ii. 33. <i>Dion. Cass.</i> <i>l.</i> 57. p. 860.

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> Dio Cassius (l. 43. p. 358. Rheim.) mentions as a report, that Julius Cæsar
employed silk curtains (παραπετάσματα Σηρικὰ) to add to the splendor of his triumph.</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>The next emperor Caligula had silk curtains to his throne
(<i>Dion. Cass. l.</i> 59. p. 915. <i>Reim.</i>), and he wore silk as part of
his dress, when he appeared in public. Dio Cassius particularly
mentions, that, when he was celebrating a kind of triumph at
Puteoli, he put on what he alleged to be the <i>thorax</i> of Alexander,
and over that a silken chlamys, dyed with the murex,
and adorned with gold and precious stones. On the following
day he wore a tunic interwoven with gold<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. The use of
shawls and tunics of silk was, however, except in the case
of the extravagances of a Caligula, still confined to the female
sex. Under the earlier emperors it is probable, that silk
was obtained in considerable quantities for the wardrobe of the
empress, where it was preserved from one reign to another, until
in the year 176 Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, the philosopher, in
consequence of the exhausted state of his treasury, sold by public
auction in the Forum of Trajan the imperial ornaments and
jewels together with the golden and silken robes of the Empress<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>The Seres must be supposed to have dwelt somewhere in the
centre of Asia. Perhaps those geographers who represent Little
Bucharia as their country<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, are nearest the truth, and thus
far neither Greeks nor Romans had penetrated. Silk was
brought to them “from nations, to which even their commerce
had not yet extended.” Hence their inaccurate ideas respecting
its origin<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

certainly the ancient Serica. Sir John Barrow (<i>Travels in China</i>, p. 435-438.)

laid it down and went away, and then returned for the price of it. The same
account is given by Eustathius, on Dyonisius, l. 752. p. 242, Bernhardy.</p>

<h5>PLINY</h5>

<p>speaks copiously and repeatedly of the manufacture of silk.
Nevertheless we learn from him scarce anything, which we did
not know from the earlier authorities. His accounts are taken
from Aristotle, from Varro, and probably also from persons who
accompanied the Parthian expeditions, or who engaged in the
trade with inner Asia. But according to his usual manner,
when he speaks of what he has not himself seen, he confounds
accounts from different witnesses, which are inconsistent with
one another. He asserts that the bombyx was a native of Cos;
but it is not probable that the women of that island would, in
such case, have recourse to the laborious operation of converting
foreign finished goods into threads for their own weaving.
It is, therefore, only reasonable to suppose that whatever manufacture
was carried on from the raw material, was, like that
of Tyre or Berytus, composed of unwrought silk imported from
the East. It is mentioned both by Theophanes and Zonares,
the Byzantine historians, that before silk-worms were brought to
Constantinople in the middle of the sixth century, no person in
that capital knew that silk was produced by a worm; a tolerably
strong evidence that none were reared so near to Constantinople
as Cos.</p>

<p>Pliny’s account of the Coan bombyx is evidently a cloud of
fable and absurdity, in which, however, we may discern a few
lines of truth, probably derived from the accounts of the silk-worm
of the Seres.</p>

<h5>PAUSANIAS,</h5>

<p>a native of Asia Minor, and an inquisitive traveller in the
second century, gives the following distinct account of Sericum
according to the ideas received among the Greeks in his time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The threads from which the Seres make webs, are not the produce of bark, but
are obtained in the following manner. There is an animal in that country, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the Greeks call <i>Ser</i>, but which <i>they</i> call by some other name. Its size is twice
that of the largest beetle. In other respects it resembles the spiders, <i>which weave
under the trees</i>. It has also the same number of feet as the spider, namely,
eight<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. In order to breed these creatures, the Seres have houses adapted both for
summer and winter. The produce of the animal is a fine thread twisted about its
legs. The Seres feed it four years on “panicum.” In the fifth year they give it
green reed, of which it is so fond as to eat of it until it bursts, and after this the
greatest part of the thread is found within its body<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> This does not apply to the silk-worm, which has sixteen legs, in pairs: six
proper legs before, and ten holders behind. (See Figure 1. <a href="#Plate_III">Plate iii.</a>)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> <i>L.</i> vi. 26. p. 125. ed. Siebel.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The most interesting circumstance, mentioned by Pausanias,
is the breeding of the silk-worms within doors in houses adapted
both for summer and winter. There seems no reason to
doubt the truth of this fact; and, if admitted, it proves, that
their country, the Serica of the ancients, lay so far North, or
was so elevated, as to have a great difference of temperature in
summer and in winter. It is remarkable, that in China the
worms are now reared in small houses, and this practice has
long prevailed in that country<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<h5>CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS,</h5>

<p>dissuading the Christian convert from luxury in dress, thus
speaks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Εἰ δὲ συμπεριφέρεσθαι χρὴ, ὀλίγον ἐνδοτέον αὐταῖς μαλακωτέροις χρῆσθαι τοῖς ὑφάσμασιν·
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
μόνον τὰς μεμωρημένας λεπτουργίας, καὶ τὰς ἐν ταῖς ὑφαῖς περιέργους πλοκὰς ἐκποδὼν μεθιστάντας·
νῆμα χρυσοῦ, καὶ σῆρας Ἰνδικοὺς, καὶ τοὺς περιέργους βόμβυκας χαίρειν ἐῶντας, ὃς σκώληξ
φύεται τὸ πρῶτον· εἶτα ἐξ αὐτοῦ δασεῖα ἀναφαίνεται κάμπη. μεθ’ ἣν εἰς τρίτην μεταμόρφωσιν
νεοχμοῦται βομβύλιον· οἱ δὲ νεκύδαλον αὐτὸ καλοῦσιν· ἐξ οὗ μακρὸς τίκτεται στήμων,
καθάπερ ἐκ τῆς ἀράχνης ὁ τῆς ἀράχνης μίτος.&mdash;<i>Pædag.</i> ii. 10.</p>

<p>But, if it is necessary to accommodate ourselves to the women, let us concede to
them the use of cloths, which are a little softer, only refusing that degree of fineness,
which would imply folly, and such webs as are <i>excessively labored</i> and <i>intricate</i>;
bidding farewell to gold thread, and to the Indian Seres, and that industrious
bombyx, which is first a worm, then puts on the appearance of a hairy caterpillar,
and hence passes, in the third place, into a Bombylius, or, as some call
it, a Necydalus; and out of which is produced a long thread, in the same manner
as the thread of the spider.&mdash;<i>Yates’s Translation.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The use of the epithet “Indian” in this passage may be accounted
for from the circumstance, that in the time of the
writer silken goods were brought to Alexandria and other cities
of Egypt from India. Clemens has evidently borrowed this
description from Aristotle.</p>

<h4>SECOND CENTURY.</h4>

<h5>TERTULLIAN.</h5>

<p>thus describes the Bombyx:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vermiculi genus est, qui per aërem liquando aranearum horoscopis idoneas
sedes tendit, dehinc devorat, mox alvo reddere; proinde si necaveris, animata jam
stamina volves.</p>

<p>It is a kind of worm, which extends abodes like the <i>dials of spiders</i> by floating
them through the air. It then devours them so as to restore them to its stomach.
Therefore, if you kill it, you will roll living threads. (See <a href="#Chapter1_IX">chap. ix</a>.)</p>
</div>

<p>In the same treatise (<i>De Pallio</i>, c. 4.) we find the following
notice:</p>

<p>Such as Hercules was in the silk of Omphale.</p>
</div>

<p>Soon after, the same author, speaking of Alexander the
Great, says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vicerat Medicam gentem, et victus est Medicâ veste:&mdash;&mdash;pectus squamarum
signaculis disculptum, textu pellucido tegendo, nudavit: et anhelum adhuc ab
opere belli, ut mollius, ventilante serico extinxit. Non erat satis animi tumens
Macedo, ni illum etiam vestis inflatior delectâsset.</p>

<p>He had conquered the Medes, and was conquered by a Median garment.
When his breast exhibited the sculptured resemblances of scales, he covered it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
with a pellucid texture, which rather laid it bare; panting from the work of war,
he cooled and mollified it by the use of silk, exposing it to the wind. It was not
sufficient for the Macedonian to have a tumid mind; he required to be delighted
also with an inflated garment.</p>
</div>

<p>He afterwards says of a philosopher,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He went wearing a garment of silk, and sandals of brass.</p>
</div>

<p>Again he says of a low character, “<i>She exposes her silk to
the wind</i>.”</p>

<p>In his treatise on Female Attire he mentions silk in relation
to Milesian wool, and he concludes that treatise in the following
terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Manus lanis occupate, pedes domi figite, et plus quam in auro placebitis. Vestite
vos serico probitatis, byssino sanctitatis, purpurâ pudicitiæ.</p>

<p>Employ your hands with wool; keep your feet at home. Thus will you please
more than if you were in gold. Clothe yourselves with the silk of probity, with
the fine linen of sanctity, and with the purple of modesty.</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, this author says (<i>Adv. Marcionem</i>, <i>l.</i> i. p. 372.),</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Imitare, si potes, apis ædificia, formicæ stabula, aranei retia, bombycis stamina.</p>

<p>Imitate, if thou canst, the constructions of the bee, the retreats of the ant, the
nets of the spider, the threads of the silk-worm.</p>
</div>

<h5>APULEIUS.</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One performed the part of a soldier, girt with a sword; another had his chlamys
tucked up by a belt, and carried scimitars and hunting-poles, as if engaged
in the chace; another, wearing gilt slippers, a silken tunic, precious ornaments,
and artificial hair, by his flowing attire represented a woman.</p>
</div>

<h5>ULPIAN.</h5>

<p>Vossius, in his <i>Etymologicum Linguæ Latinæ</i>, in the
learned and copious article <span class="smcap">Sericum</span>, says, “Inter <i>sericum</i> et
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
<i>bombycinum</i> discrimen ponit Ulpianus, l. xxiii. de aur. arg.
leg. ‘Vestimentorum sunt omnia lanea, lineaque, vel serica,
vel bombycina.’”</p>

<h5>JULIUS POLLUX.</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Bombyces are worms, which emit from themselves threads, like the spider.
Some say, that the Seres collect their webs from animals of this kind. L. vii. 76.
p. 741.&mdash;<i>Kühn.</i></p>
</div>

<h5>JUSTIN</h5>

<p>evidently refers to the use of silken garments in his account of
the customs of the Parthians, where he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They formerly dressed after their own fashion. After they became rich, they
adopted the pellucid and flowing garments of the Medes. L. xli. c. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>All doubt, whether the transparent garments, mentioned by
Justin, were of silk, must be removed by the authority of Procopius,
from whom we shall hereafter cite ample and important
testimony in reference to the time when he lived, and who in
the two following passages expressly states, that the webs,
called by the Greeks in his time <i>Seric</i>, were more anciently denominated
<i>Median</i>.</p>

<p>Among the valuable and curious effects of the emperor
Commodus, which after his death (A. D. 192.) were sold by his
successor Pertinax, was a garment with a woof of silk, of a
bright yellow color, the appearance of which was more beautiful
than if the material had been interwoven with threads of
gold<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<h4>THIRD CENTURY.</h4>

<p>The authorities now quoted supply evidence respecting the
use of silk among the Greeks and Romans down to the end of
the second century. It is rarely mentioned by any writer belonging
to the following century<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>; so far as we have discovered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
only by the three historians now to be quoted, by Cyprian, and
by Solinus. But we have from these historians some remarkable
accounts of the regard paid to it by the emperors Heliogabalus,
Alexander Severus, Aurelian, Claudius II., Tacitus, and
Carinus, all of whom reigned in the third century.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> Mannert (Geogr. iv. 6. 7. p. 517.) attributes the excessive dearness of silk in
the third century to the victories of the Persians, which at that time cut off all
direct communication between Serica and the western world.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ælius Lampridius</span> says (c. 26.), that the profligate and
effeminate emperor Heliogabalus was the first Roman, who
wore cloth made wholly of silk, the silk having been formerly
combined with other less valuable materials, and, in consequence
of his example, the custom of wearing silk soon became general
among the wealthy citizens of Rome. He mentions (c. 33)
among the innumerable extravagances of this emperor, that
he had prepared a silken rope of purple and scarlet colors to
hang himself with.</p>

<p>Of the emperor Alexander Severus he says (c. 40), that he
himself had few garments of silk, that he never wore a tunic
made wholly of silk, and that he never gave away cloth made
of silk mixed with less valuable materials.</p>

<p>The following is the testimony of Flavius Vopiscus in his life
of the emperor Aurelian.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Aurelian neither had himself in his wardrobe a garment wholly of silk, nor
gave one to be worn by another. When his own wife begged him to allow her to
have a single shawl of purple silk, he replied, Far be it from us to permit thread
to be reckoned worth its weight in gold. For a pound of gold was then the price
of a pound of silk. c. 45.</p>
</div>

<p>Although the above mentioned restrictions in the use of silk
may be partly accounted for from the usual severity of Aurelian’s
character, yet the facts here stated abundantly show the
rarity and high value of this material in that age.</p>

<p>Flavius Vopiscus further states, that the emperor Tacitus made
it unlawful for men to wear silk unmixed with cheaper materials.
Carinus, on the other hand, made presents of silken
garments, as well as of gold and silver, to Greek artificers, and
to wrestlers, players, and musicians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebellius Pollio</span>, in his life of Claudius II. (c. 14 <i>and</i>
17.), twice mentions white garments of silk mixed with cheaper
materials, which were destined for that emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<h5>CYPRIAN,</h5>

<p>Bishop of Carthage in the third century, inveighs in the following
terms against the use of silk:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tu licet indumenta peregrina et vestes sericas induas, nuda es. Auro te licet et
margaritis gemmisque condecores, sine Christi decore deformis es. <i>De Lapsis</i>, <i>p.</i>
135. <i>ed. Fell.</i></p>

<p>Although thou shouldest put on a tunic of foreign silk, thou art naked; although
thou shouldest beautify thyself with gold, and pearls, and gems, without
the beauty of Christ thou art unadorned.</p>
</div>

<p>Also in his treatise on the dress of Virgins he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sericum et purpuram indutæ, Christum induere non possunt: auro et margaritis
et monilibus adornatæ, ornamenta cordis et pectoris perdiderunt.</p>

<p>Those who put on silk and purple, cannot put on Christ: women, adorned with
gold and pearls and necklaces, have lost the ornaments of the heart and of the
breast.</p>
</div>

<p>In the same place he gives us a translation of the well-known
passage of Isaiah enumerating the luxuries of female
attire among the Jews: “In that day the Lord will take away
the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and
their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, the chains,
and the bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the
ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets,
and the ear-rings, the rings, and nose-jewels, the changeable
suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the
crisping pins, the glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods,
and the veils.” Isaiah in. 18-23.</p>

<h5>SOLINUS,</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Primos hominum Seres cognoscimus, qui, aquarum aspergine inundatis frondibus,
vellera arborum adminiculo depectunt liquoris, et lanuginis teneram subtilitatem
humore domant ad obsequium. Hoc illud est sericum, in quo ostentare potius
corpora quàm vestire, primò feminis, nunc etiam viris persuasit luxuriæ
libido. <i>Cap.</i> 1.</p>

<p>The Seres first, having inundated the foliage with aspersions of water, combed
down fleeces from trees by the aid of a fluid, and subdued to their purposes the
tender and subtile down by the use of moisture. The substance so prepared is
silk; that material in which at first women, but now even men, have been persuaded
by the eagerness of luxury rather to display their bodies, than to clothe
them.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<h5>AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS.</h5>

<p>This historian describes the Seres as “a quiet and inoffensive
people who, avoiding all quarrels with their neighbors, are
exempt from the distresses and alarms of war, and not being
under the necessity of using offensive arms, do not even know
their use, and occupy a fertile country under a delicious and
healthy climate. He represents them as passing their happy
life in the most perfect tranquillity and the most delicious repose
amidst shady thickets refreshed by pleasant zephyrs, and
where the soil furnishes so soft a wool, that after having been
sprinkled with water and combed, it forms cloths resembling
silk.”</p>

<p>Marcellinus proceeds to describe the Seres as being content
with their own felicitous condition, and so reserved in their intercourse
with the rest of mankind, that when foreigners venture
within their boundaries for wrought and unwrought silk,
and other valuable articles, they consider the price offered in
silence, and transact their business without exchanging a word;
a mode of traffic which is still practised in some eastern countries.</p>

<p>Macpherson, in the Annals of Commerce, a very valuable
work, thinks that according to all appearances, the Seres were
themselves the authors of this story, in order to make strangers
believe that their country enjoyed all these benefits by the
peculiar blessing of heaven, and that no other nation could
participate in them.</p>

<p>The remarks of Solinus and Ammianus conspire to show,
how much more common silk had become about the end of
the third century, being then worn, at least with a warp of
cheaper materials, by men as well as by women, and not
being confined to the noble and the wealthy. These authors
likewise dilate upon the use of showers of water to detach silk
from the trees on which it was found. According to Pliny and
Solinus, water was also employed after the silk was gathered
from the trees<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>: and probably the fact was so. Silk, as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
comes from the worm, contains a strong gum, which would be
dissolved by the showers of water dashed against the trees,
and thus the cocoons, being loosened from the leaves and twigs,
would be easily collected. In the subsequent processes, water
would be further useful in enabling the women to spin the silk
or to wind it upon bobbins.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> “The remaining shores are occupied by savage nations, as the Melanchlæni
and Coraxi, Dioscurias, a City of the Colchians, near the river Anthemus, being
now deserted, although formerly so illustrious, that Timosthenes has recorded
that <i>three hundred nations</i> used to resort to it <i>speaking different languages</i>;
and that business was afterwards transacted on our part through the medium of
<i>one hundred and thirty</i> interpreters.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It may be observed that in this use of water art only follows
nature. When the moth is ready to leave its cell, it always
softens the extremity of it by emitting a drop of fluid, and thus
easily obtains for itself a passage. In the third volume of the
Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society (p. 543.), Colonel
Sykes gives the following account of the process by which the
moth of the Kolisurra silk-worm liberates itself from confinement.
“It discharges from its mouth a liquor, which dissolves
or loosens that part of the cocoon adjoining to the cord which
attaches it to the branch, causing a hole, and admitting of the
passage of the moth. The solvent property of this liquid is
very remarkable; for that part of the cocoon, against which it
is directed, although previously as hard as a piece of wood, becomes
soft and pervious as wetted brown paper.”</p>

<p>In the seventh volume of the Linnæan Transactions, is an
account by Dr. Roxburgh of the Tusseh silk-worm. Both
species are natives of Bengal. The cocoons require to be immersed
in cold water before the silk can be obtained from them.
In the latter species it is too delicate to be wound from the cocoons,
and is therefore spun like cotton. Thus manufactured
it is so durable, that the life of one person is seldom sufficient
to wear out a garment made of it, and the same piece descends
from mother to daughter. (See <a href="#Chapter1_VIII">Chap. VIII.</a> of this Part.)</p>

<h4>FOURTH CENTURY.</h4>

<p>Some curious evidence respecting the use of silk, both unmixed
with linen and with the warp of linen, or some inferior
material, is found in the <span class="smcap">Edict of Diocletian</span>, which was
published A. D. 303 for the purpose of fixing a maximum of
prices for all articles in common use throughout the Roman
Empire<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. The passage pertaining to our present subject, is as

<p>This document proves, in exact conformity with the passages
quoted from Solinus and Ammianus, that silk had come into
general use at the commencement of the fourth century. It is
also manifest from this extract, that silk was employed in giving
to garments a greater proportion of intricacy and ornament
than had been in use before.</p>

<p>The authors who make mention of silk in the fourth and following
centuries are very numerous. We shall first take the
heathen authors, and then the Christian writers, whose observations
often have some moral application, which gives them an
additional interest.</p>

<p>The unknown author of the Panegyric on the emperor Constantine,
pronounced A. D. 317, thus mentions silk as characterizing
oriental refinement.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Facile est vincere timidos et imbelles, quales amœna Græcia et deliciæ Orientis
educunt, vix leve pallium et sericos sinus vitando sole tolerantes.</p>

<p>It is easy to vanquish the timid and those unused to war, the offspring of pleasant
Greece and the delightful East, who, whilst they avoid the heat of the sun,
can scarcely bear even a light shawl and folds of silk.</p>
</div>

<p>The testimony of the Roman historian <span class="smcap">Flavius Vopiscus</span>,
in reference to the practice of the emperor Aurelian and the
dearness of silk during his reign, has already been produced.
This author, in his life of the same emperor, makes the following
remarks on a display of silk which he had himself recently
witnessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have lately seen the Consulate of Furius Placidus celebrated in the Circus
with so great eagerness for popularity, that he seemed to give not prizes, but patrimonies,
presenting tunics of linen and silk, borders of linen, and even horses,
to the great scandal of all good men.</p>
</div>

<p>The exact period here referred to is no doubt the Consulship
of Placidus and Romulus, A. D. 343.</p>

<p>In the Epistles of <span class="smcap">Alciphron</span> (i. 39.) Myrrhine, a courtesan,
loosens her girdle, which probably fastened her upper garment
or shawl. Her <i>shift</i> was silk, and so transparent as to show
the <i>color</i> of her skin.</p>

<h5>AUSONIUS</h5>

<p>satirizes a rich man of mean extraction, who nevertheless
made lofty pretensions to nobility of birth, pretending to be descended
from Mars, Romulus, and Remus, and who therefore
caused their images to be embossed upon his plate and <i>woven</i>
in a silken shawl.&mdash;Epig. 26.</p>

<p>In the following line, he alludes to the production of silk in
the usual terms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<h5>QUINTUS AUR SYMMACHUS.</h5>

<p>This distinguished officer, in a letter to the Consul Stilicho,
apologizes in the following terms for his delay in sending a contribution
of Holoseric pieces, that is, webs wholly made of silk,
to the public exhibitions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Others have deferred supplying the water for the theatre and the Holoseric
pieces, so that I have examples in my favor.&mdash;<i>Epist.</i> <i>l.</i> iv. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>In a letter to Magnillus (<i>l.</i> v. 20.) he speaks of Subseric
pieces, webs made only in part of silk, as presents;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At your instigation the Subseric pieces have been supplied, which my men
kept back after the price had been settled; and likewise everything else pertaining
to the prizes which were to be given.</p>
</div>

<h5>CLAUDIAN</h5>

<p>mentions silk in numerous passages. This poet, in describing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
the consular robes of the two brothers Probinus and Olybrius
(A. D. 395.), represents the Gabine Cincture, by which the toga
was girt over the breast, as made of silk.</p>

<p>In the following passage he represents the two brothers,
Honorius and Arcadius, as dividing the empire of the world between
them and receiving tributes of its productions from the
most distant regions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Vestri juris erit, quicquid complectitur axis.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vobis rubra dabunt pretiosas æquora conchas,</div>

    <div class="verse indent6"><i>De III. Cons. Honorii</i>, <i>l.</i> 209-211.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To you the world its various wealth shall send:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their precious shells the Erythrean seas;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The distant Seres fleeces from the trees.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a poem, which immediately succeeds this in the order of
time, Claudian describes a magnificent toga, worn by Honorius
on being appointed a fourth time consul, by saying, that it received
its color (<i>the Tyrian purple</i>) from the Phœnicians; its
woof (<i>of silk forming stripes or figures</i>) from the Seres; and
its weight (<i>produced by Indian gems</i>) from the river Hydaspes<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.
Again, in his poem on the approaching marriage of
Honorius and Maria, he mentions yellow silk curtains (<i>l.</i> 211.)
as a decoration of the nuptial chamber.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> De IV. Cons. Honorii, i. 600, 601.</p>

</div>

<p>Again he says (<i>in Eutrop.</i> <i>l.</i> i. <i>v.</i> 225, 226. 304. <i>l.</i> ii. <i>v.</i>
337.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">The Arabs with their leaves, the Seres with their fleece.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He also mentions with delight the use of gold in dress, as
well as of silk. The following passage represents the manner
in which Proba, a Roman matron, near the end of the fourth
century, expressed her affectionate congratulations on the elevation
of her two sons to the Consulship, by preparing robes <i>interwoven
with gold</i> for the ceremony of their installation.</p>

<p>From these verses we learn that Proba had herself acquired
the art of <i>covering the thread with gold</i>, and that she then
used her gold thread in the <i>woof</i> to form the stripes or other
ornaments of the consular trabeæ. These are afterwards called
stiff togas (<i>togæ rigentes</i>, <i>l.</i> 205.), on account of the
rigidity imparted to them by the gold thread.</p>

<p>The same poet gives an elaborate description of a Trabea
which he supposes to have been woven by the Goddess Rome
with the aid of Minerva for the use of the Consul Stilicho.
Five different scenes are said to have been <i>woven</i> in this admirable
robe (<i>regentia dona, graves auro trabeas</i>), and certain
parts of them were wrought in gold<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>Again, Claudian supposes Thetis to have woven scarfs of gold
and purple for her son Achilles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ipsa manu chlamydes ostro texebat et auro. (<i>Ep.</i> 35.)</p>
</div>

<p>The epigram in which this line occurs, seems to imply that
Serena, mother-in-law of the Emperor Honorius, wove garments
of the same kind for him.</p>

<p>Maria, the daughter of the above-mentioned Stilicho, was
bestowed by him upon Honorius, but died shortly after, about
A. D. 400. In February, 1544, the marble coffin, containing
her remains, was discovered at Rome. In it were preserved a
garment and a pall, which, on being burnt, yielded 36 <i>pounds
of gold</i>. There were also found a great number of glass vessels,
jewels, and ornaments of all kinds, which Stilicho had
given as a dowry to his daughter<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. We may conclude, that
the garments discovered in the tomb of Maria were <i>woven</i> by
the hands of her mother Serena, since the epigram of Claudian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
proves that she wove robes of a similar description for Honorius,
and probably on the same occasion. Anastasius Bibliothecarius
says, that when Pope Paschal was intent on finding
the body of St. Cæcilia, having performed mass with a view
to obtain the favor of a revelation on the subject, he was directed
A. D. 821 to a cemetery on the Appian Way near Rome,
and there found the body enveloped in cloth of gold<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. Although
there is <i>no</i> reason to believe, that the body found by Paschal
was the body of the saint pretended, yet it may have been the
body of a Roman lady who had lived some centuries before,
and probably about the time of Honorius and Maria.</p>

<p>Virgil also represents the use of gold in weaving, as if it had
existed in Trojan times. One of the garments so adorned
was manufactured by <i>Dido</i>, the <i>Sidonian</i>, one by Andromache,
and another was in the possession of Anchises<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. In

<p>He describes an ape ludicrously attired in a silk jacket; and,
inveighing against the progress of luxury, he speaks of some
to whom even silk garments were a burthen. In elaborate

and Stilicho, he mentions the <i>reins and other trappings

<p>The frequent allusions to silk in the complimentary poems
of Claudian, receive illustration from various imperial laws,
which were promulgated in the same century, and in part by
the very emperors to whom his flattery is addressed, and which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
are preserved in the <span class="smcap">Code of Justinian</span>. Their object was
not to encourage the silk manufacture, but, on a principle very
opposite to that of modern times, to make it an imperial monopoly.
The admiration excited by the splendor and elegance
of silk attire was the ground, on which it was forbidden that
any individual of the <i>male sex</i> should wear even a silken border
upon his tunic or pallium, with the exception of the emperor,
his officers and servants. To confine the enjoyment of
these luxuries more entirely to the imperial family and court,
all private persons were strictly forbidden engaging in the
manufacture, gold and silken borders were to be made only in
the imperial Gynæcea<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<h5>THE PERIPLUS MARIS ERYTHRÆI.</h5>

<p>In this important document on ancient geography and commerce,
we find repeated mention of silk in its raw state, in that
of thread, and woven<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. These articles were conveyed down
the Indus to the coast of the Erythrean Sea. They were also
brought to the great mart of Barygaza, which was on the
Gulf of Cambay near the modern Surat, and to the coast of
Lymirica, which was still more remote. The author of the
Periplus states, that they were carried by land through Bactria
to Barygaza from a great city called <i>Thina</i>, lying far towards
the North in the interior of Asia. He of course refers to some
part of Serica. It is remarkable, that he makes no mention
of silk as the native production of India.</p>

<p>Silk is mentioned in two passages of the laws of Manu, viz.
XI. v. 168, and XII. v. 64. It is, however, observed by Heeren,
who quotes passages of the Ramayana that make mention
of silk, that garments of this material are there represented as
worn only on festive occasions, and that they were undoubtedly
Seric or Chinese productions<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. Indeed it appears that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the cloth made from the thread of the native worms of Hindostan,
although highly valued for strength and durability, is
not remarkable for fineness, beauty, or splendor.</p>

<h5>RUFUS FESTUS AVIENUS.</h5>

<p>This author, adopting the common notion of his time, supposes
the Seres to spin thread from fleeces which were produced
upon the trees. He also mentions silk shawls (<i>Serica pallia</i>,
<i>l.</i> 1008.) as worn by the female Bacchantes of Ionia in their
processions in honor of Bacchus; and it is worthy of remark,
that they are not mentioned in the original passage of Dionysius,
the author whom Avienus translates, so that we may
reasonably infer, that the use of them on these occasions was
introduced between the time of Dionysius (about 30 B. C.) and
that of Avienus (A. D. 400).</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the Christian writers of the 4th and following
centuries we may now introduce the remarks of Servius
on the passage formerly quoted from Virgil. He is supposed to
have written about A. D. 400.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the Indians and Seres there are on the trees certain worms, called
Bombyces, which draw out very fine threads after the manner of spiders; and
these threads constitute silk.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
It will be seen hereafter, that these “Indian Seres” were the
inhabitants of Khotan in Little Bucharia.</p>

<p>The frequent comparison of Bombyces to spiders by the ancients
suggests the inquiry whether they employed the thread
of any kind of spider to make cloth, as was attempted in
France by M. Bon. The failure of his attempt is sufficient,
as it appears, to show, that the extensive manufacture of garments
from this material must have been scarcely possible in
ancient times. It is also to be observed, that the ancients,
when they compare the silk-worm to the spider, refer to the
spider’s <i>web</i>, whereas M. Bon, not finding the web strong
enough, made his cloth from the thread with which the spider
envelopes its eggs<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">[58]</a> The most extraordinary account of a spider’s web, which we have ever seen,
is that given by Lieutenant W. Smyth. He says, “We saw here (<i>viz.</i> at Pachiza,
on the river Huayabamba in Peru) a gigantic spider’s web suspended to the
trees: it was about 25 <i>feet in height</i>, and near 50 <i>in length</i>; the threads were
very strong, and it had the empty sloughs of thousands of insects hanging on it.
It appeared to be the habitation of a great number of spiders of a larger size than
we ever saw in England.” Narrative of a Journey from Lima to Para, London,
1836, p. 141.</p>

<p>For some interesting notices of the great spider of Brazil the reader is referred
to Caldcleugh’s Travels in South America, London 1825, vol. i. ch. 2. p. 41; and
to the Rev. R. Walsh’s Notices of Brazil, London 1830, vol. ii. p. 300, 301. Mr.
Caldcleugh “<i>assisted in liberating from a spider’s net a bird of the size of a
swallow, quite exhausted with struggling, and ready to fall a prey to its indefatigable
enemies</i>.” Mr. Walsh had his light straw hat removed from his head
by a similar web extending from tree to tree in an opening through which he had
occasion to pass. He wound upon a card several of the threads composing the
web; and he observes, that, as these spiders are gregarious, the difficulties experienced
by M. Bon from the ferocity of the solitary European spiders in killing
and devouring one another, would not exist if the attempt were made to obtain
clothing from the former.</p>

<p>In the forests of Java Sir George Staunton “found webs of spiders, woven
with threads of so strong a texture as not easily to be divided without a cutting
instrument.”&mdash;Account of Lord Macartney’s Embassy to China, London 1797,
vol. i. ch. 7. p. 302. (See <a href="#Chapter1_IX">Chap. IX.</a>)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But, although we have no reason to believe, that the web of
any spider was anciently employed to make cloth, yet these
accounts may have referred to worms, possibly varieties of the
silk-worm, which spun long threads floating in the air. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
common silk-worm spins and suspends itself by its thread, long
before it begins its cocoon. It appears probable, therefore, that
there may have been wild varieties of this creature, or perhaps
other species of the same genus, which in the earlier stages of
their existence spun threads long enough for use. We ground
this conjecture partly on the following passage from Du Halde’s
History of China<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="label">[59]</a> Vol. ii. p. 359, 360, 8vo. edition, London, 1736.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The province of Chan-tong produces a particular sort of silk, which is found
in great quantities on the trees and in the fields. It is spun and made into a stuff
called <i>Kien-tcheou</i>. This silk is made by little insects that are much like caterpillars.
They do not spin an oval or round cocoon, like the silk-worms, but very
long threads. These threads, as they are driven about by the winds, hang upon
the trees and bushes, and are gathered to make a sort of silk, which is coarser
than that made of the silk spun in houses. But these worms are wild, and eat
indifferently the leaves of mulberry and other trees. Those who do not understand
this silk would take it for unbleached cloth, or a coarse sort of drugget.</p>

<p>“The worms, which spin this silk, are of two kinds: the first, much larger and
blacker than the common silk-worms, are called <i>Tsouen-kien</i>; the second, being
smaller, are named <i>Tiao-kien</i>. The silk of the former is of a reddish gray, that
of the latter darker. The stuff made of these materials is between both colors, it
is very close, does not <i>fret</i>, is very lasting, washes like linen, and, when it is good,
receives no damage by spots, even though oil were to be shed on it.</p>

<p>“This stuff is much valued by the Chinese, and it is sometimes as dear as
satin or the finest silks. As the Chinese are very skilful at counterfeiting, they
make a false sort of <i>Kien-tcheou</i> with the waste of the Tche-kiang silk, which
without due inspection might easily be taken for the genuine article.”</p>
</div>

<p>This account affords a remarkable illustration of many of
the expressions of the ancient writers, such as “Bombyx pendulus
urget opus,” <i>Martial</i>; “Per aerem liquando aranearum
horoscopis idoneas sedes tendit,” <i>Tertullian</i>; “In aranearum
morem tenuissima fila deducunt,” <i>Servius</i>.</p>

<p>In further illustration of the subject, and as tending to show
that the <i>Kien-tcheou</i> is manufactured from the thread of a
silk-worm, modified in its habits and perhaps in its organization
by circumstances, we shall now quote a few passages from a work
having the following title: “<i>China; its costume, arts, manufactures,
&amp;c., edited from the originals in the cabinet of
M. Bertin, with observations by M. Breton. Translated
from the French. London, 1812.</i>” <i>Vol.</i> iv. <i>p.</i> 55, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The wild silk-worms are found in the hottest provinces of China, especially
near Canton. They live indifferently on all sorts of leaves, particularly on those
of the ash, the oak, and the fagara, and spin a greyish and rarely white silk.
The coarse cloth manufactured from it is called <i>Kien-tcheou</i>, will bear washing,
and on that account persons of quality do not disdain to wear clothes of it. With
this silk also the strings of musical instruments are made, because it is stronger
and more sonorous.</p>

<p>“Entomologists treat but very superficially of the habits of the wild silk-worms,
while they dwell in minute detail on the method of rearing them in Provence.</p>

<p>“It is between the nineteenth and twenty-second day of their existence, that
they undertake the great work of spinning their cocoon. They curve a leaf
into a kind of cup, and then form a cocoon as large and nearly as hard as a hen’s
egg! This cocoon has one end open like a reversed funnel; it is a passage for
the butterfly, which is to come out.</p>

<p>“The oak-worms are slower in making their cocoon than those of the fagara
and ash, and they set about it differently. Instead of bending a single leaf, they
roll themselves in two or three and spin their cocoon. It is larger, but the silk is
inferior in quality, and of course not so valuable.</p>

<p>“The cocoons of wild silk-worms are so strong and compact, that the insects
encounter great difficulty in extricating themselves, and therefore remain inclosed
from the end of the summer, to the spring of the following year. These butterflies,
unlike the domestic insect, fly very well.&mdash;The domestic silk-worm is but a
variety of the wild species. It is fed on the leaves of the mulberry tree.” (See
<a href="#Chapter1_VIII">chap. VIII.</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>The circumstance that the worms were sometimes fed with
oak-leaves is mentioned in Du Halde’s History of China,
vol. ii. p. 363.</p>

<p>Here then we have a justification of the ancients in asserting,
both that the silk-worms produced <i>long threads and webs floating
in the air like those of spiders</i>, and that they fed upon
the leaves of the oak, the ash, and many other trees. It may
be recollected, that Pliny expressly mentions both the oak
(<i>quercus</i>) and the ash (<i>fraxinus</i>).</p>

<p>Until very lately the use of silk among the ancients was investigated
only by philologists. Within a few years M. Latreille,
an entomologist of the highest distinction, has directed his attention
to the subject and has examined particularly the above-cited
passages of Aristotle, Pliny, and Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. He never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
supposes the ancient Sericum to have been the produce of anything
except the silk-worm. But of this there are several varieties,
partly perhaps natural, and partly the result of domestication.
He endeavors to explain some parts of Pliny’s description
by showing their seeming correspondence with some of the
practices actually observed by the Orientals in the management
of silk-worms.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">[60]</a> M. Latreille’s paper is published in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles, tome
xxiii. pp. 58-84.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>An account of the wild silk-worms of China is to be found
in the “Mémoires concernant l’Histoire, les Sciences, les Arts,
&amp;c., des Chinois,” compiled by the missionaries of Peking<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.
This account is principally derived from the information of Father
D’Incarville, one of the missionaries. It coincides generally
with the accounts already quoted from Du Halde and
Breton. We extract the following particulars as conveying
some further information:</p>

abridgments as an Appendix to Stanislas Julien’s Translation of the Chinese
Treatise on the Breeding of Silk-worms, Paris, 1837, 8vo.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Chinese annals from the year 150 B. C. to A. D. 638 make frequent
mention of the great quantity of silk produced by the wild worms, and observe
that their cocoons were as large as eggs or apricots.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following passage is also deserving of attention: “Le
papillon de ces vers sauvages, dit le Père d’Incarville, est à ailes
vitrées.” This information, if correct, would prove that there
was at least one kind of wild silk-worms in China, which was
a different species from the Phalæna Mori; for that has no
transparent membranes in its wings, and would not be likely to
receive them in consequence of any change in its mode of life.</p>

<p>We now proceed to take the Christian authors of the fourth
and following centuries in the order of time.</p>

<h5>BASIL, CL., A. D. 370.</h5>

<p>Although this celebrated author was a native of Asia Minor,
and had studied in Syria and Palestine, he appears to have
known the silk-worm only from books and by report. His description
of it in the following passage, in which we first find
the beautiful illustration of the doctrine of a <i>resurrection</i> from
the change of the chrysalis, is chiefly copied from Aristotle’s account
as formerly quoted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Τί φάτε οἱ ἀπιστοῦντες τῷ Παύλῳ περὶ τῆς κατὰ τὴν ἀνάστασιν ἀλλοιώσεως, ὁρῶντες πολλὰ
τῶν ἀερίων τὰς μορφὰς μεταβάλλοντα; ὁποῖα καὶ περὶ τοῦ Ἰνδικοῦ σκώληκος ἱστορεῖται τοῦ
κερασφόρου· ὃς εἰς κάμπην τὰ πρῶτα μεταβαλὼν, εἶτα προϊὼν βομβυλιὸς γίνεται, καὶ οὐδὲ ἐπὶ
ταύτης ἵσταται τῆς μορφῆς, ἀλλὰ χαύνοις καὶ πλατέσι πετάλοις ὑποπτεροῦται. Ὅταν οὖν
καθέζησθε τὴν τούτων ἐργασίαν ἀναπηνιζόμεναι αἱ γυναῖκες, τὰ νήματα λέγω, ἃ πέμπουσιν
ὑμῖν οἱ Σῆρες πρὸς τὴν τῶν μαλακῶν ἐνδυμάτων κατασκευὴν, μεμνημέναι τῆς κατὰ τὸ ζῶον
τοῦτο μεταβολῆς, ἐναργῆ λαμβάνετε τῆς ἀναστάσεως ἔννοιαν, καὶ μὴ ἀπιστεῖτε τῇ ἀλλαγῇ,
ἣν Παῦλος ἅπασι κατεπαγγέλλεται.&mdash;<i>Hexahemeron</i>, <i>p.</i> 79. <i>A. Ed. Benedict.</i></p>

<p>What have you to say, who disbelieve the assertion of the Apostle Paul concerning
the change at the resurrection, when you see many of the inhabitants of
the air changing their forms? Consider, for example, the account of the horned
worm of India, which (i. e. the silk-worm) having first changed into a caterpillar
(<i>eruca</i>, or <i>veruca</i>), then in process of time becomes a cocoon (<i>bombylius</i>, or <i>bombulio</i>),
and does not continue even in this form, but assumes light and expanded
wings. Ye women, who sit winding upon bobbins the produce of these animals,
namely the threads, which the Seres send to you for the manufacture of fine garments,
bear in mind the change of form in this creature; derive from it a clear
conception of the resurrection; and discredit not that transformation which Paul
announces to us all.&mdash;Yates’s Translation.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
When St. Basil says of the new-born moth, that “it assumes
light and expanded wings,” the beauty of the comparison
in illustrating the Christian doctrine of the resurrection
is enhanced, when we consider that in its <i>wild</i> state the moth
flies very well, although, when domesticated, its flight is weak
and its wings small and shrivelled<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>: but still more beautiful
does the figure become, if we suppose a reference to those
larger and more splendid Phalænæ which produce the coarser
kinds of silk in India, and probably in China also.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">[63]</a> The Phalæna Atlas, apparently a native of China, measures eight inches
across the wings from tip to tip.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Basil is the <i>first</i> writer, who distinctly mentions the change
of the silk-worm from a Chrysalis to a moth. In his application
of that fact he addresses himself to his countrywomen in
Asia Minor, and his language represents them sitting and
winding on bobbins the raw silk obtained from the Seres and
designed to be afterwards woven into cloth.</p>

<p>Between these two authors, Aristotle and Basil, we observe
a difference of phraseology which appears deserving of notice.
While they both describe the women, not as spinning the
silk, but as <i>winding it on bobbins</i>, they designate the material
so wound by two different names. Basil uses the term
 νήματα, which might be meant to imply that the silk came
from the Seres in skeins as it comes to us from China: Aristotle,
on the contrary, uses the term βομβύκια, which can only
refer to the state of silk before it is wound into skeins.
As it might appear impossible to convey it in this state to
Cos, we shall here insert from the authorities already quoted,
the Chinese Missionaries, an account of the process by which
the cocoons are prepared for winding, and it will then be seen,
that the cocoons might have been transported to any part of
the world.</p>

<p>“To prepare the cocoons of the wild silk-worms, the
Chinese cut the extremities of them with a pair of scissors.
They are then put into a canvass bag, and immersed for an
hour or more in a kettle of boiling lye, which dissolves the
gum. When this is effected, they are taken from the kettle;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
pressed to expel the lye, and then laid out to dry. Whilst
they are still moist, the chrysalises are extracted; each cocoon
is then turned inside out, so as to make a sort of cowl. It is
necessary only, to put them again into lukewarm water,
after which ten or twelve of them are capped one upon another
like so many thimbles, to insert a small distaff through
them, when the silk may be reeled off.”</p>

<p>Basil, in one of his Homilies, (<i>Opp. tom.</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 53. 55. <i>ed.
Benedict.</i>) inveighs against the ladies of Cæsarea, who employed
themselves in weaving gold; and he is no less indignant
at their husbands who adorned even their horses with
cloths of gold and scarlet as if they were bridegrooms.</p>

<p>The author of a Treatise “De disciplinâ et bono pudicitiæ,”
which is usually published with Cyprian, and which may be
referred to the fourth or fifth century, thus speaks (<i>Cypriani
Opera, ed. Erasmi, p.</i> 499.):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To weave gold in cloth is, as it were, to adopt an expensive method of spoiling
it. Why do they interpose stiff metals between the delicate threads of the warp?</p>
</div>

<p>The same censure is implied in the following address of Alcimus
Avitus to his sister.</p>

<p>Here we think it not out of place to introduce the account of
the silk-worm by Georgius Pisida, who flourished about A. D.
640, although he lived at Constantinople after the breeding
of silk-worms had been introduced there. According to him
the silk-worm pines or moulders almost to nothing in its tomb,
and then returns to its former shape. The verses are however
deserving of attention for their elegance, and for the repetition
of Basil’s idea, which Ambrose has left out, of the analogy between
the restoration of the silk-worm and the resurrection of
man.</p>

<h5>MACARIUS, CL., A. D. 373.</h5>

<p>This author gives us an additional proof (<i>Homil.</i> 17, § 9,) that
the use of silken clothing was characteristic of dissolute women.</p>

<h5>JEROME, CL., A. D. 378.</h5>

<p>This great author mentions silk in numerous passages.</p>

<p>In his translation of Ezekiel xxvii. he has supposed silk
(<i>sericum</i>) to be an article of Syrian and Phœnician traffic as
early as the time of that prophet.</p>

<p>In his beautiful and interesting Epistle to Læta on the Education
of her Daughter (<i>Opp. Paris</i>, 1546, <i>tom.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 20. C.),
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let her learn also to spin wool, to hold the distaff, to place the basket in her
bosom, to twirl the spindle, to draw the threads with her thumb. Let her despise
the webs of silk-worms, the fleeces of the Seres, and gold beaten into threads.
Let her prepare such garments as may dispel cold, not expose the body naked,
even when it is clothed. Instead of gems and silk, let her love the sacred
books, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Because we do not use garments of silk, we are reckoned monks; because we
are not drunken, and do not convulse ourselves with laughter, we are called restrained
and sad: if our tunic is not white, we immediately hear the proverb, He
is an impostor and a Greek.&mdash;<i>Epist. ad Marcellum, De Ægrotatione Blesillæ,
tom.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 156, <i>ed. Erasmi</i>, 1526.</p>

<p>You formerly went with naked feet; now you not only use shoes, but even
ornamented ones. You then wore a poor tunic and a <i>black</i> shirt under it, dirty
and pale, and having your hand callous with labor; now you go adorned with
linen and silk, and with vestments obtained from the Atrebates and from Laodicea.&mdash;<i>Adv.
Jovinianum, l.</i> ii. <i>Opp. ed. Paris</i>, 1546, <i>tom.</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 29.</p>
</div>

<p>In the following he further condemns the practice of wrapping
the bodies of the dead in cloth of gold:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Why do you wrap your dead in garments of gold? Why does not ambition
cease amidst wailings and tears? Cannot the bodies of the rich go to corruption
except in silk?&mdash;<i>Epist.</i> L. ii.</p>

<p>You cannot but be offended yourself, when you admire garments of silk and
gold in others.&mdash;<i>Epist.</i> L. ii. No. 9, <i>p.</i> 138, <i>ed. Par.</i> 1613, <i>12mo.</i></p>

shoes with silk thread, observing that it was a shame even to
wear it woven in shawls. Such is the change of circumstances,
that now even the poorest persons of both sexes, if decently
attired, have silk in their shoes.</p>

<h5>HELIODORUS, CL., A. D. 390.</h5>

<p>This author, describing the ceremonies at the nuptials of
Theagenes and Chariclea, says, “The ambassadors of the
Seres came, bringing the thread and webs of their spiders, one
of the webs dyed <i>purple</i> (!), the other white.” <i>Æthiopica,
lib.</i> x. <i>p.</i> 494. <i>Commelini.</i></p>

<p>Salmasius (<i>in Tertullianum de Pallio, p.</i> 242.) quotes the
following passage from <i>an uncertain author</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ τοῦ παρόντος βίου τερπνότης Ἰνδικῷ σκωληκιῷ, ὅπερ τῷ φυλλῷ τοῦ δένδρου

<p>The pleasure of the present life is like the Indian worm, which, having involved
itself in the leaf of the tree and having been satisfied with food, chokes itself
in the cocoon of its own thread.&mdash;Yates’s Translation.</p>
</div>

<p>This writer, whoever he was, appears to have had a correct
idea of the manner in which the silk-worm wraps itself in a
leaf of the tree, on which it feeds, and spins its tomb within<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">[64]</a> In the Royal Museum of Natural History at Leyden are eight or ten cocoons
of the Phalæna Atlas from Java. They consist of a strong silk, and are formed
upon the leaves of a kind of Ficus. The first layer of the cocoon covers the
whole of a leaf, and receives the exact impress of its form. Then two or three
other layers are distinctly perceptible. Two or three leaves are joined together to
form the cocoon. In regard to the looseness of the layers these cocoons do not
correspond to M. Breton’s description of the cocoons of the wild silk-worms of
China, which are very strong and compact, and therefore more resemble those of
the Phalæna Paphia.</p>

<p>In the same Hymn (<i>l.</i> 1015.) Prudentius describes a heathen

held up by the Gabine cincture (<i>Cinctu Gabino Sericam fultus

the cincture only, not the whole toga, was of silk. It was used
to fasten and support the toga by being drawn over the breast.</p>

<h5>PALLADIUS.</h5>

<p>A work remains under the name of Palladius on “The
Nations of India and the Brachmans.” Whether it is by the
same Palladius, who wrote the Historia Lausiaca, is disputed.
But, as we see no reason to doubt, that it may have been written
as early as his time, we introduce here the passages, which
have been found in it, relating to the present subject. The author
represents the Bramins as saying to Alexander the Great,
“You envelope yourselves in soft clothing, like the silk-worms.”
(<i>p.</i> 17. <i>ed. Bissœi.</i>) It is also asserted, that Alexander did not
pass the Ganges, but went as far as Serica, where the silk-worms
produce raw-silk (p. 2.).</p>

<p>In the London edition this tract is followed by one in Latin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
bearing the name of St. Ambrose and entitled <span class="smcap">De moribus
Brachmanorum</span>. It contains nearly the same matter with
the preceding. The writer professes to have obtained his information
from “Musæus Dolenorum Episcopus,” meaning, as
it appears from the Greek tract, Moses, Bishop of Adule, of
whom he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sericam ferè universam regionem peragravit: in quâ refert arbores esse, quæ
non solum folia, sed lanam quoque proferunt tenuissimam, ex quâ vestimenta con
ficiuntur, quæ Serica nuncupantur. <i>p.</i> 58.</p>

<p>He travelled through nearly all the country of the Seres, in which, he says,
that there are trees producing not only leaves, but the finest wool, from which
are made the garments called Serica.</p>
</div>

<p>These notices are not devoid of value as indicating what
were the first steps to intercourse with the original silk country.
It may however be doubted, whether the last account here
quoted is a modification of the ideas previously current among
the Greeks and Romans, or whether it arose from the mistakes
of Moses himself, or of other Christian travellers into the interior
of Asia, <i>who confounded the production of silk with
that of cotton</i>.</p>

<h5>THE THEODOSIAN CODE,</h5>

<p>published A. D. 438, mentions silk (<i>sericam et metaxam</i>) in
various passages.</p>

<h5>APOLLINARIS SIDONIUS, CL., A. D. 472.</h5>

<p>Describing the products of different countries, this learned author
says (<i>Carmen.</i> v. <i>l.</i> 42-50),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">His fleeces, the Sabean frankincense.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a passage (<i>Carmen.</i> xv.), he mentions a pall,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Cujus bis coctus aheno</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Serica Sidonius fucabat stamina murex.</div>

  </div>

</div>

<p>The expression here used, indicates that the silk thread was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
brought from the country of the Seres to be dyed in Phœnice.
In Horace we have already noticed the “Coæ purpuræ.”</p>

<p>A passage from the Burgus Pontii Leontii (<i>Carmen.</i> xxii.),
shows that the same article (<i>Serica fila</i>) was imported into
Gaul.</p>

<p>In the same author (<i>l.</i> ii. <i>Epist. ad Serranum</i>) we meet
with “Sericatum toreuma.” The latter word probably denoted
a carved sofa or couch. The epithet “sericatum” may have
referred to its silken cover.</p>

<p>The same author describes Prince Sigismer, who was about
to be married, going in a splendid procession and thus clothed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ipse medius incessit, flammeus cocco, rutilus auro, lacteus serico.</p>

<p>
<i>L.</i> iv. <i>Epist. p.</i> 107. <i>ed. Elmenhorstii</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>He himself marched in the midst, his attire flaming with coccus, glittering
with gold, and of milky whiteness with silk.</p>
</div>

<p>Describing the heat of the weather, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One man perspires in cotton, another in silk.</p>

<p>
<i>L.</i> ii. <i>Epist.</i> 2.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, in the following lines he alludes to the practice of
giving silk to the successful charioteers at the Circensian
games:</p>

<p>The Tyrians are chiefly known to us in commercial history
for their skill in dyeing; the Tyrian purple formed one of the
most general and principal articles of luxury in antiquity: but
dyeing could scarcely have existed without weaving, and
though we have no direct information respecting the Tyrian
and Sidonian looms, we possess several ancient references to
their excellence, the less suspicious because they are incidental.
Homer, for instance, when Hecuba, on the recommendation of
the heroic Hector, resolves to make a rich offering to Minerva,
describes her as selecting one of Sidonian manufacture as the
finest which could be obtained.</p>

<p>Tyre appears to have been the only city of antiquity which
made dyeing its chief occupation, and the staple of its commerce.
There is little doubt that purple, the sacred symbol of
royal and sacerdotal dignity, was a color discovered in that
city; and, that it contributed to its opulence and grandeur.
It is related that a shepherd’s dog, instigated by hunger, having
broken a shell on the sea shore, his mouth became stained
with a color, which excited the admiration of all who saw it,
and that the same color was afterwards applied with great success
to the dyeing of wool. According to some of the ancient
writers, this discovery is placed in the reign of Phœnix, second
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
King of Tyre (five hundred years before the Christian era);
others fix it in that of Minos, who reigned 939 years earlier or,
1439 B. C. The honor of the invention of dyeing purple, is
however, generally awarded to the Tyrian Hercules, who presented
his discovery to the king of Phœnicia; and the latter
was so jealous of the beauties of this new color, that he forbade
the use of it to all his subjects, reserving it for the garments of
royalty alone. Some authors relate the story differently: Hercules’
dog having stained his mouth with a shell, which he had
broken on the seashore, Tysus, a nymph of whom Hercules
was enamored, was so charmed with the beauty of the color,
that she declared she would see her lover no more until he had
brought garments dyed of the same. Hercules, in order to
gratify his mistress, collected a great number of the shells, and
succeeded in staining a robe of the color she had demanded.
“Colored dresses,” says Pliny<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, “were known in the time of
Homer (900 B. C.), from which the robes of triumph were borrowed.”
Purple habits are mentioned among the presents
made to Gideon, by the Israelites, from the spoils of the kings
of Midan. Ovid, in his description of the contest in weaving
between Minerva and Arachne, dwells not only on the beauty
of the figures which the rivals wove, but also mentions the delicacy
of shading by which the various colors were made to harmonize
together:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
The Tyrian purple was communicated by means of several
species of univalve shell-fish. Pliny gives us an account of two
kinds of shell-fish from which the purple was obtained. The
first of these was called <i>buccinum</i>, the other <i>purpura</i><a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. A
single drop of the liquid dye was obtained from a small vessel
or sac, in their throats, to the amount of only <i>one drop</i> from
<i>each</i> animal! A certain quantity of the juice thus collected
being heated with sea salt, was allowed to ripen for three days,
after which it was diluted with five times its bulk of water, kept
at a moderate heat for six days more, occasionally skimmed,
to separate the animal membranes, and when thus clarified,
was applied directly as a dye to white wool, previously prepared
for this purpose, by the action of lime-water, or of a species of
lichen called fucus. Two operations were requisite to communicate
the finest Tyrian purple; the first consisted in plunging
the wool into the juice of the purpura, the second into that of
the buccinum. Fifty drachms of wool required one hundred
of the former liquor, and two hundred of the latter. Sometimes
a preliminary tint was given with cocus, the kermes of
the present day, and the cloth received merely a finish from
the precious animal juice. The color appears to have been
very durable; for Plutarch observes in his life of Alexander<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>,
that, at the taking of Susa, the Greeks found in the royal
treasury of Darius a quantity of purple stuffs of the value of
five thousand talents, which still retained its beauty, though it
had lain there for one hundred and ninety years<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>We now come to the very interesting account of the first introduction
of silk-worms into Europe, which is given by Procopius
in the following terms. (<i>De Bello Gothico</i>, iv. 17.)</p>

<p>“About this time (A. D. 530.) two monks, having arrived
from India, and learnt that Justinian was desirous that his
subjects should no longer purchase raw silk from the Persians,
went to him and offered to contrive means, by which the Romans
would no longer be under the necessity of importing this
article from their enemies the Persians or any other nation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
They said, that they had long resided in the country called
Serinda, one of those inhabited by the various Indian nations,
and had accurately informed themselves how raw silk might
be produced in the country of the Romans. In reply to the
repeated and minute inquiries of this Emperor, they stated,
that the raw silk is made by worms, which nature instructs
and continually prompts to this labor; but that to bring the
worms alive to Byzantium would be impossible; that the
breeding of them is quite easy; that each parent animal produces
numberless eggs, which long after their birth are covered
with manure by persons who have the care of them, and being
thus warmed a sufficient time, are hatched. The Emperor
having promised the monks a handsome reward, if they would
put in execution what they had proposed, they returned to India
and brought the eggs to Byzantium, where, having hatched
them in the manner described, they fed them with the leaves
of the <i>Black Mulberry</i>, and thus enabled the Romans thenceforth
to obtain raw silk in their own country.”</p>

<p>The same narrative, abridged from Procopius, is found in
Manuel Glycas (<i>Annal. l.</i> iv. <i>p.</i> 209.), and Zonares (<i>Annal. l.</i>
xiv. <i>p.</i> 69. <i>ed. Du Cange.</i>). In the abstract given by Photius
(<i>Biblioth. p.</i> 80. <i>ed. Rotham</i>) of the history of Theophanes
Byzantinus, who was a writer of nearly the same age with Procopius,
we find a narrative, in which the only variation is, that
a Persian brought the eggs to Byzantium in the hollow stem
of a plant. The method now practised in transporting the
eggs from country to country is to place them in a bottle not
more than half full, so that by being tossed about, they may be
kept cool and fresh. If too close, they would probably be heated
and hatch on the journey<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The authors who have hitherto treated of the history of the
silk-worm, have supposed the Serinda of Procopius to be the
modern Sir-hind, a city of Circar in the North of Hindostan<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Notwithstanding the striking similarity of names, we think it
more likely that Serinda was adopted by Procopius as another
name for Khotan in Little Bucharia. The ancients included
Khotan among the Indian nations<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>: and that they were right
in so doing is established from the facts, that Sanscrit was the
ancient language of the inhabitants of Khotan; that their alphabetical
characters, their laws, and their literature resembled
those of the Hindoos; and that they had a tradition of being Indian
in their origin<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. Since, therefore, Khotan was also included
in the ancient Serica, a term probably of wide and rather
indefinite extent<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>; the name <i>Serinda</i> would exactly denote
the origin and connexions of the race which occupied
Khotan.</p>

<div class="footnote">

of Khotan appear to have been included; and also to Cellarii Antiqui Orbis

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> De Guignes (Hist. Gen. des Huns, tome i. p. v.) expresses his opinion, that
Serica, besides the North of China, included the countries towards the West, which
were conquered by the Chinese, viz. Hami, Turfan, and other neighboring territories.
Rennell (Mem. of a map of Hindostan) agrees with D’Anville, <i>that Serica
was at the Northwest angle of the present empire of China</i>. Heeren decides
in favor of the same opinion, supposing Serica to be identical with the modern
Tongut. Comment. Soc. Reg. Scient. Gottingensis, vol. xi. p. 106. 111. Gottingæ,
1793.</p>

<p>Pausanias observes that the Seres, in order to breed the insects which produced
silk, had houses adapted both for summer and winter, which implies that there
was a vast difference between the summer and winter temperature of their country.
A late oriental traveller says of the climate of Khotan, “In the summer,
when melons ripen, it is very hot in these countries; but, during winter, extremely
cold.”&mdash;Wathen’s Memoir on Chinese Tartary and Khotan, in Journal of
the Asiatic Society of Bengal, December 1835, p. 659.</p>

<p>On referring to the map, <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>, the reader will see the position of Serica
indicated at its Eastern extremity. As that map is limited to the <i>Orbis Veteribus
Cognitus</i>, only a small space on its border is marked as the country of silk
indicated by the yellow color. It is, nevertheless, pretty certain that silk may be
justly placed next in order to wool.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, although Sir-hind is termed “an ancient
city” by Major Rennell<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, we cannot find any evidence that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
silk-worm was ever bred there. So far is this from being the
case, that it appears to be a country very ill adapted for the production
of silk<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. It may indeed be true, as stated by Latreille,
that Sir-hind was colonized from Khotan, and it may be mentioned
as a remarkable circumstance in confirmation of this
supposition, that there is a town called Kotana a little way to
the North East of the City of Sir-hind. But, supposing this
account to be correct, it is highly probable that the settlement
of Sir-hind as a colony of Khotan did not take place till after
the year 530, when the breeding of silk-worms was according
to Procopius introduced into Europe from “Serinda.” Rather
more than 120 years before this time India was visited by the
Chinese traveller, Fa Hian, who on his way passed some
months with great delight and admiration in Khotan; and the
special object of whose journey was to see and describe all the
cities of India where Buddhism was professed. The inhabitants
of Khotan being wholly devoted to that delusion, the
same system must have been established in its colony; and,
since this zealous pilgrim crossed India at no great distance
from the spot where Sir-hind afterwards stood, we cannot doubt
that he would have mentioned it, if it had existed in his age.
He says not a word about it; and the time is comparatively so
short between his visit to India and the date of the introduction
of silk-worms into Europe, that we can scarcely suppose Sir-hind,
the colony of Khotan and consequently the seat of Buddhism,
to have been in existence either at the former or latter period<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>In another passage of his history (<i>Bell. Pers.</i> 1. 20.) Procopius
throws some light upon our subject by stating that in
consequence of the monopoly of the trade in raw silk by the
Persians, Justinian attempted to obtain it through the Æthiopians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of Arabia, but found this to be impracticable, as the
Persian merchants frequented the ports to which the Indians
resorted, and from them purchased all their cargoes.</p>

<p>Procopius further states (<i>Hist. Arcana, c.</i> 25.), that <i>silk
shawls</i> had long been manufactured in the Phœnician cities
Tyre and Berytus (to which all who were concerned in the
silk trade, either as merchants or manufacturers, consequently
resorted, and from whence goods were carried to every part of
the earth); but that in the reign of Justinian the manufacturers
in Byzantium and other Greek cities raised the prices of
their goods, alleging that the Persians had also advanced theirs,
while the imposts were increased among the Romans. Justinian,
pretending to be much concerned at the high prices, forbade
any one in his dominions to sell silk for more than eight
<i>aurei</i> per pound, threatening confiscation of goods against any
one who transgressed the law. To comply was impossible,
since they were required to sell their goods at a price lower than
that for which they bought them. They therefore abandoned
the trade, and secretly sold the remnant of their goods for what
they could get. The Empress Theodora, on being apprised of
this, immediately seized the goods and fined the proprietors a
hundred <i>aurei</i> besides. It was then determined, that the silk
manufacture should be carried on solely by the Imperial Treasurer.
<span class="smcap">Peter Barsames</span> held the office, and conducted himself
in relation to this business in the most unjust and oppressive
manner, so that the silk-trade was ruined not only in Byzantium
but also at Tyre and Berytus, while the Emperor,
Empress and their Treasurer amassed great wealth by the
monopoly.</p>

<h5>MENANDER PROTECTOR, A. D. 560-570.</h5>

<p>In an account of an embassy sent to Constantinople by the
Avars of Sarmatia, this author states, that the Emperor Justinian
endeavored to excite their admiration by a display of
splendid couches, gold chains, and garments of silk<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The establishment of the Turkish power in Asia, about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
middle of the sixth century, together with subsequent wars, had
greatly interrupted the caravan trade between China and
Persia. On the return of peace, the Sogdians, an Asiatic people,
who had the greatest interest in the revival of the trade,
persuaded the Turkish sovereign, whose subjects they were become,
to send an embassy to Chosroes, king of Persia, to open
a negotiation for this purpose. Maniak, a Sogdian prince, who
was ambassador, being instructed to request that the Sogdians
might be allowed to supply the Persians with silk; presented
himself before the Persian monarch in the double character of
merchant and envoy, carrying with him many bales of silken
merchandise, for which he hoped to find purchasers among the
Persians. But Chosroes, who thought the conveyance by sea
to the Persian Gulf more advantageous to his subjects than this
proposed traffic, was not disposed to lend a favorable ear to the
legation, and rather uncourteously showed his contempt for the
Sogdian traders. He bought up all the silk which the ambassador
had carried with him, and immediately burned it before
them; thus giving the most convincing proof of the little value
which it had in his estimation.</p>

<p>After this the Persians and Chinese united against the Turks,
who, to strengthen themselves, sought an alliance with the
Emperor Justin. Maniak was again appointed ambassador,
and sent to negotiate the terms of the alliance; but disappointment,
though from a dissimilar cause, attended this his second
embassy. The sight of silk-worms, and the establishment for
manufacturing their produce, in Constantinople, were to him as
unwelcome as unexpected; he however concealed his mortification,
and, with perhaps an overstrained civility, acknowledged,
that the Romans were already become as expert as the Chinese
in both the management of silk-worms and manufacture of
their silk<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>; and when in the fourth year of Justin II. (<i>i. e.</i> A. D.
569.) they went on the same mission to Byzantium, they found
that here also there was no demand, since silk-worms were
bred there already. Soon after this we learn· that the Byzantines
sent an embassy to Disabul, King of the Sogdiani, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
received the ambassadors in tents covered with variously-colored
silks.</p>

<p>Bombyx frondium vermis, ex cujus texturâ Bombycinum conficitur. Appellatur
autem hoc nomine ab eo quod evacuetur dum fila generat, et aer solus in eo
remanet.&mdash;<i>Origin. l.</i> xii. <i>c.</i> 5.</p>

<p>Bombyx, a worm which lives upon the leaves of trees, and from whose web
silk is made. It is called Bombyx, because it empties itself in producing threads,
and nothing but air remains within it.</p>

<p>The cloth called <i>Bombycina</i>, derives its name from the silk-worm (<i>Bombyx</i>),
which emits very long threads; the web woven from them is called Bombycinum,
and is made in the island of Cos.</p>

<p>That called <i>Serica</i> derives its name from silk (<i>sericum</i>), or from the circumstance,
that is was first obtained from the Seres.</p>

<p><i>Holoserica</i> is all of silk: for <i>Holon</i> means <i>all</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tramoserica</i> has a warp of linen; and a woof (<i>trama</i>) of silk.&mdash;L. xix. c. 22.</p>
</div>

<p>Touching these extracts we would remark, that the testimony
of Isidore must not be considered as proving, that the
silk manufacture still existed in Cos. His statement was no
doubt merely copied from Varro or Pliny, or founded upon the
authority of other writers long anterior to his own age. It is
indeed probable that silk-worms had by this time been brought
into Greece, but that he was ignorant of the fact.</p>

</div>

<p>We have, moreover, the following account of the origin of
the growth and manufacture of silk in that country (p. 55, 56.).</p>

<p>“The monastery of Lou-che (<i>occupied by Buddhists</i>) is to
the south-west of the royal city. Formerly the inhabitants of
this kingdom had neither mulberries nor silk-worms. They
heard of them in the East country, and sent an embassy to ask
for them. The King of the East refused the request, and issued
the strictest injunctions to prevent either mulberries or
silk-worms’ eggs from being conveyed across the border. Then
the King of Kiu-sa-tan-na (<i>i. e.</i> <i>Koustana</i>, or <i>Khotan</i>) asked
of him a princess in marriage. This having been granted, the
king charged the officer of his court who went to escort her, to
say, that in his country there were neither mulberry-trees nor
cocoons, and that she must introduce them, <i>or be without silk
dresses</i>. The princess, having received this information, obtained
the seed both of mulberries, and silk-worms, which
she concealed in her head-dress. On arriving at the frontier,
the officers searched every where, but dare not touch the turban
of the princess. Having arrived at the spot, where the
monastery of Lou-che was afterwards erected, she deposited
the seed both of the mulberries and worms. The trees were
planted in the spring, and she afterwards went herself to assist
in gathering the leaves. At first the worms were fed upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
leaves of other plants, and a law was enacted, that no worms
were to be destroyed or sacrificed until their quantity was sufficiently
great. The monastery was founded to commemorate so
great a benefit, and some trunks of the original mulberry-trees
can yet be seen there<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="label">[80]</a> It may be observed, that the folds of the turban are not unfrequently used in
the East to convey articles of value. See Journal of a Tour in Asia Minor, by
Charles Fellows, London, 1839, p. 216.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the following passage (<i>Règne Animal, par Cuvier, tom.</i>
v. <i>p.</i> 402.,) Latreille mentions Turfan as an important city as
far as it affected the early silk-trade. In other respects his account
coincides with that already given.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“La ville de Turfan, dans la petite Bucharie, fut long-temps le rendez-vous
des caravanes venant de l’Ouest, et l’entrepôt principal des soieries de la Chine.
Elle était la métropole des Sères de l’Asie supérieure, ou de la Sérique de Ptolémée.
Expulsés de leurs pays par les Huns, les Sères s’établirent dans la grande
Bucharie et dans l’Inde. C’est d’une de leurs colonies, du Ser-hend (<i>Ser-indi</i>),
que des missionaires Grecs transportèrent, du temps de Justinien, les œufs du ver
à soie à Constantinople.”</p>

<p>The City of Turfan in Little Bucharia was for a long time the rendezvous of
the caravans coming from the West, and the principal market for Chinese silks.
It was the metropolis of the Seres of Upper Asia, or the Serica of Ptolemy. The
Seres having been expelled their country by the Huns, established themselves in
Great Bucharia and in India. It is from one of their colonies (of Ser-indi), that
the Grecian Missionaries, in the time of Justinian, brought the eggs of the silk-worm
to Constantinople.</p>
</div>

<p>A diploma of <span class="smcap">Ethelbert</span>, King of Kent, mentions “Armilausia
holoserica,” proving that silk was known in England
at the end of the sixth century<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. The usual dress of the
earliest French kings seems to have been a linen shirt and
drawers of the same material next to the skin; over these a
tunic, probably of fine wool, which had a border of silk, ornamented
sometimes with gold or precious stones; and upon this
a sagum, which was fastened with a fibula on the right shoulder.
Eginhart informs us, that Charlemagne wore a tunic, or
vest, with a silken border (<i>limbo serico</i>)<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<h5>ALDHELMUS, CL., A. D. 680.</h5>

<p>This author, who died Abbot of Sherburn, was among the
most learned men of his age. In his Ænigmas, which are
written in tetrastics, we find the following description of the
silk-worm. As it is scarcely possible that he could have seen
this creature, we have cause to admire both the ingenuity and
general accuracy of his lines. The ascending to the tops of
thorns or shrubs, such as “genistæ,” to which the animal may
attach its cocoon (<i>globulum</i>), has not been noticed by any
earlier author.</p>

<p>In a book written by this author, in praise of virginity, he
observes, That chastity alone did not form an amiable and perfect
character, but required to be accompanied and adorned by
many other virtues; and this observation he further illustrates
by the following simile taken from the art of weaving: “As it
is not a web of one uniform color and texture, without any
variety of figures, that pleaseth the eye and appears beautiful,
<i>but one that is woven by shuttles, filled with threads of purple,
and many other colors, flying from side to side, and
forming a variety of figures and images</i>, in different compartments,
with admirable art.”&mdash;<i>Bibliotheca Patrum, tom.</i> xiii.</p>

<h4>EIGHTH CENTURY.</h4>

<h5>BEDE, CL., A. D. 701.</h5>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Joseph autem mercatus est sindonem, et deponens eum involvit sindone. (<i>Marc.</i>
xv. 46.)&mdash;Et ex simplici sepultura domini ambitio divitum condemnatur, qui ne in
tumulis quidem possunt carere divitiis. Possumus autem juxta intelligentiam spiritalem
hoc sentire, quod corpus domini non auro, non gemmis et serico, sed linteamine
puro obvolvendum sit, quanquam et hoc significet, quod ille in sindone munda
involvat Jesum, qui pura eum mente susceperit. Hinc ecclesiæ mos obtinuit,
ut sacrificium altaris non in serico, neque in panno tincto, sed in lino terreno celebretur,
sicut corpus est domini in sindone munda sepultum, juxta quod in gestis
pontificalibus a beato Papâ Silvestro legimus esse statutum.&mdash;<i>Expos. in Marcum,
tom.</i> v. <i>p.</i> 207. <i>Col. Agrip.</i> 1688.</p>

<p>But Joseph bought a linen cloth, and, taking him down, wrapped him in the
linen cloth. (Mark xv. 46.)&mdash;The simple burial of our Lord condemns the ambition
of rich men, who cannot be without wealth even in their tombs. That his
body is to be wrapped not in gold, not in silk and precious stones, but in pure
linen, may be understood by us spiritually. It also intimates, that he incloses
Jesus in a clean linen cloth, who receives him with a pure mind. Hence the
custom of the church has obtained, to celebrate the sacrifice of the altar, not in
silk, nor in dyed cloth, but in earthy flax, as the body of our Lord was buried in
a clean linen cloth; for so we read in the pontifical acts, that it was decreed by
the blessed Pope Silvester.</p>
</div>

<p>The latter portion of this extract, wherein we are informed
of the origin of the practice, universally adopted, of covering
the Eucharist with a white linen cloth, must be a <i>later</i> addition.
Pope Silvester lived, as the reader will perceive, long
<i>after</i> the time of Bede.</p>

<p>Bede, in his History of the Abbots of Wearmouth, states
that the first abbot and founder of the monastery, Biscop, surnamed
Benedict, went a fifth time to Rome for ornaments and
books to enrich it, and on this occasion (A. D. 685.) brought
two <i>scarfs</i>, or palls, of incomparable workmanship, composed
entirely of silk, with which he afterwards purchased the land
of three families situated at the mouth of the Wear<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. This
shows the high value of silken articles at that period.</p>

<p>About the year 970 Kenneth, king of Scotland, paid a visit

to evince at once his friendship and munificence, bestowed upon

hundred ounces of pure gold<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<h5>GERBERT, CL., A. D. 970.</h5>

<h4>TWELFTH CENTURY.</h4>

<h5>THEODORUS PRODROMUS,</h5>

<p>a romance writer in the twelfth century, mentions the <i>figured
shawls</i> (πέπλα) manufactured by the Seres.</p>

<p>The breeding of silk-worms in Europe appears to have been
confined to Greece from the time of the Emperor Justinian
until the middle of the twelfth century. The manufacture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of silk was also very rare in other parts of Europe, being probably
practised only as a recreation and accomplishment for
ladies. But in the year 1148 Roger I., King of Sicily, having
taken the cities of Corinth, Thebes, and Athens, thus got into
his power a great number of silk-weavers, took them away
with the implements and materials necessary for the exercise
of their art, and forced them to reside at Palermo<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. Nicetas
Choniates<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, referring to the same event, speaks of these artisans
as of both sexes, and remarks that in his time those who
went to Sicily might see the sons of Thebans and Corinthians
employed in weaving velvet stoles <i>interwoven with gold</i>, and
serving like the Eretrians of old among the Persians<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>We find in the writings of Ingulphus several curious accounts
of vestments of silk, interwoven with eagles and flowers
of gold. This author, in his history, mentions that among
other gifts made by Witlaf, king of Mercia, to the abbey of
Croyland, he presented <i>a golden curtain, embroidered with
the siege of Troy</i>, to be hung up in the church on his birth-day<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.
At a later period, 1155, a pair of richly worked sandals,
and three mitres, the work of Christina, abbess of Markgate,
were among the valuable souvenirs presented by Robert,
abbot of St. Albans, to Pope Adrian IV.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> Adrian IV., was the only Englishman that ever sat in St. Peters chair. His
name was Nicolas Breakspear: he was born of poor parents at Langley, near St.
Albans. Henry II., on his promotion to the papal chair, sent a deputation of an
abbot and three bishops to congratulate him on his election; upon which occasion
he granted considerable privileges to the abbey of St. Albans. With the exception
of the presents named above, he refused all the other valuable ones which
were offered him, saying jocosely,&mdash;“I will not accept your gifts, because when
I wished to take the habit of your monastery you refused me.” To which the
abbot pertinently and smartly replied,&mdash;“It was not for us to oppose the will of
Providence, which had destined you for greater things.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Without digressing from our subject to question the right
of the royal marauder thus tyrannously to sever these unoffending
artisans from the ties of country and of kindred, we
may yet be allowed to express some satisfaction at the consequences
of his cruelty. It is well for the interests of humanity
that blessings, although unsought and remote, do sometimes
follow in the train of conquest; that wars are not always limited
in their results to the exaltation of one individual, the
downfall of another, the slaughter of thousands, and misery
of millions, but occasionally prove the harbingers of peaceful
arts, heralds of science, and in short deliverers from the yoke
of slavery or superstition.</p>

<p>In twenty years from this forcible establishment of the manufacture,
the silks of Sicily are described as having attained a
decided excellence; as being of diversified patterns and colors;
some fancifully interwoven with gold tastefully embellished
with figures; and others richly adorned with pearls. The industry
and ingenuity thus called forth, could not fail to exercise
a beneficial influence over the character and condition of
the Sicilians.</p>

<p>From Palermo the manufacture of silk extended itself
through all parts of Italy and into Spain. We learn from
Roger de Hoveden, that the manufacture flourished at Almeria
in Grenada about A. D. 1190<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<h4>FOURTEENTH CENTURY.</h4>

<p>According to Nicholas Tegrini<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>, the silk manufacture afterwards
flourished in Lucca; and the weavers, having been
ejected from that city in the earlier part of the fourteenth century,

even to Germany, France, and Britain.</p>

<p>We have seen from different historical testimonies, that silk
was known to the inhabitants of France and England as early
as the sixth century. The fact of its introduction into all parts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
of the North of Europe is manifest from the use of words for
silk in several northern languages. These words appear, according
to the inquiries of the learned orientalists, Klaproth
and Abel Rémusat<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, to have been derived from those Asiatic
countries, in which silk was originally produced. In the language
of Corea silk is called <i>Sir</i>; in Chinese <i>Se</i>, which may
have been produced by the usual omission of the final <i>r</i>. In
the Mongol language silk is called <i>Sirkek</i>, in the Mandchou
<i>Sirghè</i>. In the Armenian the silk-worm is called <i>Chèram</i>.
In Arabic, Chaldee, and Syriac, silk was called Seric<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. From
the same source we have in Greek and Latin Σηρικὸν, Sericum.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="label">[93]</a> Journal Asiatique, 1823, tom. ii. p. 246. Julius Klaproth (Tableau Historique
de l’Asie, Paris, 1826, p. 57, 58.) says, that in the year 165 B. C. the inhabitants
of the country called by us Tangut, who constituted a powerful kingdom,
were attacked by the Hioung Nou, and driven to the West, where they fixed
themselves in Transoxiana, and that these events led to an uninterrupted communication
with Persia and India, especially in regard to the silk trade. Klaproth
considers that the Seres of the ancients were the Chinese; but he appears to
include under that term all the nations which were brought into subjection to the
Chinese.</p>

<p>Professor Karl Ritter (Erdkunde, Asien, Band iv. 2 te Auflage, Berlin, 1835,
p. 437.) observes, in allusion to the authority just quoted, that all the names of
the silk-worm and its products are to be accounted for on the supposition (which
he considers the true one) that they were first known and cultivated in China,
and from thence extended through central Asia into Europe.</p>

<p>According to Abel Rémusat (<i>Journal Asiat. l. c.</i>) the merchandise
of Eastern Asia passed through Slavonia to the North
of Europe in the middle ages, even without the mediation of
Greece or Italy. This may account for the use of the terms
of the first class, while it is possible that those of the second
have been derived from the South of Europe, from whence we
have seen that silken commodities were also occasionally transported
to the North.</p>

<p>To the evidence now produced from <i>authors</i> and <i>printed
documents</i> respecting the history of silk from the earliest times
to the period of its universal extension throughout Europe, another
species of proof may be added, viz. that afforded by Relics
preserved in churches, and by other remains of the antiquities
of the middle ages. As examples of this method for illustrating
the subject, the following articles may be enumerated.</p>

<p>I. The relics of St. Regnobert, Bishop of Bayeux in the
seventh century. These consist of a <i>Casula</i>, or <i>Chasuble</i>, a
<i>Stole</i>, and a <i>Maniple</i>. They are yet preserved in the cathedral
of Bayeux, and worn by the Bishop on certain annual festivals.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
They are of silk <i>interwoven with gold</i>, and <i>adorned
with pearls</i><a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

de la Ville de Caen, Séance d’Avril 14, 1820.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>II. Portions of garments of the same description with those
of St. Regnobert were discovered A. D. 1827 on opening the
tomb of St. Cuthbert in the Cathedral of Durham. They are
preserved in the library of that church, and accurately described
by the Rev. James Raine, the librarian, in a quarto volume.</p>

<p>III. The scull-cap of St. Simon, said to have been made
in the tenth century, and now preserved in the Cathedral of
Treves. Its border is <i>interwoven with gold</i>.</p>

<p>In regard to these interesting relics, they may with confidence
be looked upon as specimens of the manufacture of silk
from the <i>seventh</i> to the <i>twelfth</i> century.</p>

<p>IV. In the Cathedral at Hereford is a charter of one of the
Popes with the bull (the leaden seal), attached to it by silken
threads. Silk was early used for this purpose in the South of
Europe<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. The Danish kings began to use silk to append the
waxen seals to their charters about the year 1000<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.</p>

<p>V. Silk, in the form of velvet, may be seen on some of the
ancient armor in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>VI. The binding of ancient manuscripts affords specimens
of silk. A French translation of Ludolphus Saxo’s Life of
Christ in four folio volumes, among Dr. William Hunter’s
MSS. at Glasgow, still has its original binding covered with
red velvet, which is probably as old as the <i>fourteenth</i> century.
A curious source of information on the art of book-binding at
that period is the Inventory, or Catalogue of the library collected
by that ardent lover of books, Charles V. of France.
As this catalogue particularly describes the bindings of about
1200 volumes, many of which were very elaborate and splendid,
it enables us to judge of the use made of all the most valuable
stuffs and materials which could be employed for this purpose,
and under the head of silk we find the following: “soie,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
silk; “veluyau,” velvet; “satanin,” satin; “damas,” damask;
“taffetas,” taffetas; “camocas;” “cendal;” and “drap d’or,”
cloth of gold, having probably a basis or ground of silk<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<p>From the few examples of ancient Catholic vestments that
have escaped destruction, the generality of persons are but
little acquainted with the extreme beauty of the embroidery
worked for ecclesiastical purposes during the Middle Ages.
The countenances of the images were executed with perfect
expression, like miniatures in illuminated manuscripts. Every
parochial church, previous to the Reformation, was furnished
with complete sets of frontals and hangings for the altars. One
of the great beauties of the ancient embroidery was its appropriate
design; each flower, leaf, and device having a significant
meaning with reference to the festival to which the vestment
belonged. Such was the extreme beauty of the English
vestments in the reign of Henry III., that Innocent IV. forwarded
bulls to many English bishops, enjoining them to send
a certain quantity of embroidered vestments to Rome, for the
use of the clergy<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104" class="label">[104]</a> The art of embroidery seems to have attained a higher degree of perfection
in France, than any other country in Europe;&mdash;it is not, however, so much practised
now. Embroiderers formerly composed a great portion of the working population
of the largest towns; laws were specially framed for their protection,
some of which would astonish the working people of the present day. They
were formed into a company as early as 1272, by Etienne Boileau, Prévot de
Paris, under their respective names of “Brodeurs, Découpeurs, Egratigneurs, and
Chasubliers.”</p>

<p>In the last and preceding centuries, when embroidery, as an article of dress
both for men and women, was an object of considerable importance, the Germans,
and more particularly those of Vienna, disputed the palm of excellence
with the French. At the same period, Milan and Venice were also celebrated
for their embroidery; but the prices were so extravagantly high, that according
to Lamarre, its use was forbidden by sumptuary laws.</p>

<p>The use of gold in <i>weaving</i> may be traced to the earliest
times, but seems to be particularly characteristic of oriental
manners.</p>

<p>It was employed in connexion with woollen and linen thread
of the finest colors to enrich the ephod, girdle, and breast-plate
of Aaron<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. The sacred historian goes so far as to describe the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
mode of preparing the gold to be used in weaving: “And they
did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work
it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the
fine linen, with cunning work.”&mdash;Ex. xxxix. 2-8. The historian
certainly does not intend to describe the process of wire-drawing,
nor probably the art of making gold thread. It
seems likely, that neither of these ingenious manufactures
were invented in his time. The queen described in Ps. xiv.,
wears “clothing of wrought gold<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.” Homer mentions a golden
girdle, (Od. ε. 232.  κ. 543.). He also describes an upper garment,
which Penelope made for Ulysses before going to Illium.
On the front part of it a beautiful hunting piece was wrought
in gold. It is thus described. “A dog holds a fawn with its
fore feet, looking at it as it pants with fear and strives to make
its escape.” This, he says, was the subject of universal admiration<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p>Pisander, who probably lived at the same period with Homer,
speaks of the Lydians as wearing tunics adorned with gold.
Lydus, who has preserved this expression of the ancient cyclic

<p>Virgil also represents the use of gold in weaving, as if it had
existed in Trojan times. One of the garments so adorned was
made by Dido, the Sidonian, another by Andromache, and a
third was in the possession of Anchises<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. In all these instances

<p>Among all the Asiatics, none were more remarkable than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the Persians for the display of textures of gold, as well as every
other kind of luxury in dress. A tiara interwoven with gold
was one of the presents which Xerxes gave as an expression of
his gratitude to the citizens of Abdera (<i>Herod.</i> viii. 120.).
The Indians also employed the same kind of ornament (<i>Strabo</i>,
L. xv. <i>c.</i> i. § 69.); and the Periegesis (<i>l.</i> 881.) of Priscian attributes
the use of it to the Arabians<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>The history of Alexander the Great affords frequent traces
of the use of cloth <i>interwoven with gold</i> in Persia. Garments
made of such cloth were among the most splendid of the
spoils of Persepolis<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<p>Justin (L. xii.) says that Alexander, to avoid offending the
Persians, ordered his principal attendants to adopt for their
dress “longam vestem auream purpureamque.” The dress
prescribed was therefore of fine woollen cloth, or probably of
silk, dyed purple, and <i>interwoven with gold</i>. Among the vast
multitudes which preceded the King of Persia when he advanced
to oppose Alexander, was the band of ten thousand
called the Immortals, whose dress was carried to the ‘ne plus
ultra’ of barbaric splendor, some wearing golden collars, others
“cloth variegated with gold.” Some idea of the extravagance
and pomp of the Persians on this occasion may be formed from
the following passage, taken from Rollin’s “Ancient History.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The order Darius observed in his march was as follows. Before the army
were carried silver altars, on which burned the fire, called by them sacred and
eternal; and these were followed by the magi, singing hymns, and 365 youths <i>in
scarlet robes</i>. After these proceeded a consecrated car, drawn by white horses
and followed by one of an extraordinary size, which they called “The horse of the
sun.” The equerries were dressed in white, each bearing in his hand a golden
rod. Next appeared ten sumptuous chariots, enriched with curious sculptures in
gold and silver; and then the vanguard of the horse, composed of twelve different
nations, in various armor. This body was succeeded by those of the Persians,
called “The Immortals,” amounting to 10,000, who surpassed the rest of the
barbarians in the extravagant richness and splendor of their dress; for they all
wore <i>collars of gold</i>, and were clothed in robes <i>of gold tissue</i>, having large
sleeves, garnished with precious stones. About thirty paces from them came the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
king’s relations or cousins, to the number of 15,000, apparelled like women, and
more remarkable for the pomp of their dress than the glitter of their arms; and after
these Darius attended by his guards, seated on a chariot, as on a throne. The
chariot was enriched, on both sides, with images of the gods in gold and silver;
and from the middle of the yoke, which was covered with jewels, rose two statues,
a cubit in height; the one representing War, the other Peace, having between
them a golden eagle with wings extended. The king was attired in <i>a garment
of purple striped with silver</i>; over which was a long robe, glittering with gold
and precious stones, and whereon two falcons were represented as if rushing from
the clouds at each other. Around his waist he wore <i>a golden girdle</i>, from whence
hung scimitar, the scabbard of which was covered with gems. On each side of
Darius walked 200 of his nearest relations, followed by 10,000 horsemen, whose
lances were plated with silver, and tipped with gold. After these marched 30,000
foot, the rear of the army, and, lastly, 400 horses belonging to the king.</p>

<p>“About 100 paces from the royal divisions of the army came Sisygambis, the
mother of Darius, seated on a chariot, and his consort on another, with female attendants
of both queens riding on horseback. Afterwards came fifteen chariots,
in which were the king’s children, and their tutors. Next to these were the royal
concubines, to the number of 360, all attired like so many queens. These were
followed by 600 mules, and 300 camels, carrying the king’s treasure, and guarded
by a body of bowmen. After these came the wives of the crown officers, and the
lords of the court; then the suttlers, servants; and, lastly, a body of light armed
troops, with their commanders.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the nuptials of Alexander purple and scarlet cloths, <i>interwoven
with gold</i>, were expanded over the guests: and a
pall of the same description covered the golden sarcophagus
made to contain his body. Among the splendid ornaments of
the tent erected not long after at Alexandria by Ptolemy Philadelphus,
there were tunics interwoven with gold: and in the
procession on the same occasion, the colossal statues of Bacchus
and his nurse Nysa were attired; the former in a shawl; the
latter in a tunic variegated with gold. Probably we may refer
to the same country and age the “golden tunic” mentioned in
one of the Arundle marbles (No. xxii. 2.). Also the tent pitched
by Arsace with hangings of gold and purple tissues, and
the robe of similar materials worn by Arsace herself, as described
by Heliodorus (<i>Æthiop.</i> vii.), relate to the customs of
the same country.</p>

<p>Another of the successors of Alexander, viz. Demetrius
Poliorcetes, wore purple garments with <i>borders of gold</i><a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

Themistius describes a portrait of one of the kings of Persia,
who wore, together with the tiara and the collar or necklace,
<i>a purple shawl interwoven with gold</i> (<i>Orat.</i> 24. <i>p.</i> 369. <i>ed.</i>
Dindorf.).</p>

<p>During the periods to which the preceding evidence has allusion,
it is not probable that cloth of gold was in use among the
Greeks and Romans except to a very limited extent. Nevertheless
it does not appear to have escaped the avidity for every
species of excellence, which in early times distinguished the inhabitants
of Magna Græcia. For, when Pythagoras became
a teacher of wisdom and philosophy at Crotona, among other
lessons of frugality he persuaded the matrons to put off their
“golden garments” with other fashionable ornaments, and deposit
them in the temple of Juno as offerings to the goddess<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.
In a passage attributed to Menander we meet with the mention
of a “golden or purple chlamys” as a suitable offering to
the gods<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. Hedylus of Samos, a writer of the same age, describes
a woman of loose morals, by name Niconoe, as wearing
a tunic striped with gold (<i>Brunck’s Analecta</i>, i. 483.).</p>

<p>Attalus, king of Pergamus, is said by Pliny (L. viii. cap. 48.)
to have invented the art of embroidering with gold thread<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.
Nevertheless we have seen, that gold was thus used long before
the time of Attalus. But there can be no doubt, that he established
and maintained a great manufacture of these stuffs
at Pergamus; thus contributing greatly to improve the art,
and bring these cloths into more general use.</p>

<p>The next passage is from Dr. Bostock’s translation of the
33rd Book, ch. xix. “Gold may be spun or woven like wool,
without the latter being mixed with it. We are informed by
Verrius, that Tarquinius Priscus rode in triumph in a tunic of
gold; and we have seen Agrippina, the wife of the Emperor
Claudius, when he exhibited the spectacle of a naval combat,
sitting by him covered with a robe made <i>entirely</i> of <i>woven
gold</i>. In what are called the Attalic stuffs, the gold is woven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
with some other substance. This art was the invention of one
of the kings of Asia.”</p>

<p>In Book xxxv. c. 36. Pliny says that Zeuxis, to display his
wealth at Olympia, caused his name to be woven <i>in gold</i> in
the compartments of his outer garment.</p>

<p>Caligula once wore a tunic interwoven with gold. Heliogabalus
was far more profuse in regard to this kind of splendor.
White sheets, <i>interwoven with gold</i>, were used at the funeral
obsequies of Nero<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. We may here observe, that the use of gold
in dress almost invariably accompanied that of silk. The
same Emperors who took delight in the one, indulged themselves
with the other also. On the contrary, Alexander Severus,
as we shall show when treating of linen in Part IV., was
economical in both these respects.</p>

make mention of cloth of gold, from Tibullus, Ovid, Seneca
the Tragedian, Lucan, Dio Cassius, Claudian, Virgil, Gregorius
Nazienzenus, and Basil, all of which speak of cloth of gold.
Ovid mentions purple garments variously colored and interwoven
with gold, as belonging to Bacchus.&mdash;<i>Met.</i> iii. 556.</p>

<p>Publius Syrus was a writer of the same period. In the following

<p>This is the <i>first</i> passage since the time of Homer, which mentions
Greece as concerned in weaving with gold. But Ausonius
probably alluded to the Greeks of Asia Minor, as, besides
the evidence produced from Basil, we have seen that Pergamus
was one of the most noted places for these productions, which
were on that account called “Attalicæ vestes<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.”</p>

in use even in the days of Homer; and that these gave rise to the <i>triumphal</i>.
To produce this effect with the needle was the invention of the Phrygians, on
which account cloths so embroidered have been called <i>Phrygionic</i>. In the same
part of Asia king Attalus discovered the art of inserting a woof of gold(?); from
which circumstance the <i>Attalic</i> cloths received their name(?). Babylon first obtained
celebrity by its method of <i>diversifying the picture with different colors</i>,
and gave its name to textures of this description. But to weave with <i>a great
number of leashes</i>, so as to produce the cloths called <i>polymita</i> (the polymita were
damask cloths), was <i>first</i> taught in Alexandria; to divide by squares (<i>plaids</i>) in
Gaul. Metellus Scipio brought it as an accusation against Cato, that even in his
time Babylonian <i>coverlets</i> for triclinia were sold for 800,000 sesterces (about
$30,000), although the emperor Nero lately gave for them no less than 4,000,000
sesterces (about $150,000). The <i>prætextæ</i> of Servius Tullius, covering the statue
of Fortune which he dedicated, remained until the death of Sejanus, and it is

<p>The testimony of Ambrose, Jerome, and Basil has been
given in Chapter III., which see.</p>

<p>From the book of Joshua we learn that the woven stuffs of
Babylon were not confined to domestic use, but exported into
foreign countries. The two chief productions of Babylonian
looms were <i>carpets</i> and <i>shawls</i>. One of the principal objects
of luxury in Asia from the remotest ages, were nowhere so
finely woven, and in such rich colors as at Babylon. On the
Babylonian carpets were woven or depicted representations of
those fabulous animals the dragon and griffin, together with
other unnatural combinations of form, probably originating in
India, and with which we have become acquainted by the
ruins of Persepolis. It was by means of the Babylonian manufactures,
that the knowledge of these fanciful and imaginary
beings, was conveyed to the Western world, and from them
transferred to the Greek vases. “A mantle of Shinar,” or as
our translators have rendered it, “A Babylonish garment,”
was secreted by Achan from the spoils of Jericho; and the
delinquent speaks of this as being the most valuable part of his
plunder<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. Next to carpets and shawls, the Babylonian garments
called <i>Sindones</i> were held in the highest estimation. The
most costly <i>Sindones</i>, were so much valued for their fineness
of texture and brilliancy of color, as to be compared to those of
Media, and set apart for royal use; they were even to be found
at the tomb of Cyrus, which was profusely decorated with every
species of furniture in use among the Persian monarchs during
their lives.</p>

<p>The Evangelist Luke, in Acts xii. 21. speaks of the “royal
apparel,” in which Herod Agrippa, king of Judea, was arrayed
when he received the ambassadors of Tyre and Sidon, sitting
in great state upon his throne at Cæsarea. “And upon a set
day, Herod arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and
made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout,
saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. And immediately
the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up
the ghost.”</p>

<p>Josephus describes the same garment, which was a tunic,
as “all made of <i>silver</i>, and wonderful in its texture.” He
adds, that the king appeared in this dress at break of day in
the theatre, and that the silver, illuminated by the first rays
of the sun, glittered in such a manner as to terrify the beholders,
so that his flatterers began to call out aloud, saluting him
as a god. <i>He was then seized with the painful and loathsome

<p>We extract the following curious account of the discovery
of Ancient Piece-goods and manufactured stuffs from a late
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
number of an English publication called the “Mining Review.”</p>

<p>Discovery of ancient Piece-goods and manufactured stuffs.&mdash;“It
is more than a thousand years since Theodolphus, Bishop
of Orleans, gave to Notre Dame du Puy en Velay a beautiful
manuscript, containing the ancient Testament, the chronography
of St. Isidor, and other pieces, the whole distributed into
138 articles; which he presented in token of gratitude for his
deliverance from the prison of Angers, where he was confined
in the year 835. It was on Palm Sunday that year, while
Louis Le Debonnaire was passing, that he began to sing a
well-known Canticle, which the Catholic church <i>has since
then</i> introduced into its ceremonies. This precious manuscript,
in a state of perfect preservation, is to be seen in the
archives of the Bishopric of the Puy en Velay, department of
the Haute Loire. A portion of the manuscript is written on
leaves of common parchment, in letters of red and black, with
a few of gold intermixed. The other portion is inscribed on
leaves of parchment, dyed purple, with <i>letters of gold</i> and
<i>silver</i>, among which are observed, ornaments of different kinds
and colors, designated the “<i>Byzantine style</i>.” The manuscript,
remarkable for its beauty and preservation, is still more
valuable for the manufactured stuffs which it contains. When
Theodolphus composed his manuscript, with the intention of
preserving from contact and friction the gold and silver characters
(which, in time, would have tended to displace and obliterate
them), he placed between each page a portion of the
manufactured tissues peculiar to the era in which he lived.
These specimens of the silk, and other pieces of goods of the
time are thus curiously preserved<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. Till lately, little attention
was paid to these tissues, which are principally of India manufacture,
bearing scarcely <i>any analogy</i> to the products of the
<i>modern loom</i>. Some are CASHMERE SHAWLS of those
patterns, which the French call <i>broucha</i> and <i>espouline</i>, and are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
made in the Indian fashion, but with this difference, that they
are limited to <i>four</i> colors, and demonstrate the greatest antiquity
by the primitive simplicity of their colors and design.
Others are CRAPES and GAUZES, against the luxury of
whose transparent tissues, the fathers of the church at that
time so perseveringly fulminated their censures. The rest
consist of <i>muslins</i> and <i>China-crape of exquisite beauty</i>.
The components of the majority of these tissues are of goats’
or camels’ hair of exceeding delicacy and fineness. Like the
manufactured stuffs of ancient Egypt, painted on the walls of
its palaces and tombs, or substantially preserved amidst the
envelopes of mummies, the designs are limited to four colors,
which are in fact the <i>four sacred ones of China</i>, <i>India</i>,
<i>Egypt</i>, and the <i>Hebrew Tabernacle</i>. Nevertheless, the
Egyptian designs, <i>identical with those of India</i>, are many
of them of exquisite beauty. The consummate skill of the
silk and cotton manufacturers of ancient Egypt, 4000 years
ago, <i>the beauty and richness of their fabrics</i>&mdash;the little alteration
which has taken place in the economy or machinery of
the factories, as well as in their product, has been recently demonstrated
in the great work of Champollion. All the details
of the silk and cotton factories of Egypt, under the Pharaohs
of the 18th dynasty (which then monopolized the commerce
of the world, and sent a colony of weavers, from the overburthened
population of Lower Egypt, to found Athens, and the
subsequent civilization of Europe), are laid open with vivid accuracy
in that splendid work<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, and brought with all their startling
analogies before the eye of the modern reader by drawings
from the temples, palaces, and tombs which it contains. It
proves, indeed, that there is ”<i>nothing new under the sun</i>.”</p>

<p>That the Egyptians excelled in science and art is evident
from their monuments, paintings, and sculptures, whereon they
are depicted. It is also proved by Scripture, which speaks of
the “wisdom of Egypt” with reference to art; and from the
fact that Egypt was deemed by other nations the fountain of
arts and sciences, and that their philosophers were wont to resort
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
thither to collect some of the “droppings of Egyptian wisdom.”
According to Diodorus, all trades vied with each other
in improving their own particular branch, no pains being
spared to bring each to perfection. To promote the more effectually
this object, it was enacted that no artisan should follow
any trade or employment but that defined bylaw, and <i>pursued
by his ancestors</i>. No tradesman was permitted to meddle
with political affairs, or hold any civil office in the state, <i>lest
his thoughts should be distracted by the inconsistency of his
pursuits</i>, or the jealousy and displeasure of the master in
whose service he was employed. They foresaw that without
such a law constant interruptions would take place, in consequence
of the necessity or desire of becoming conspicuous in a
public station; that their proper occupations would be neglected,
and many would be led by <i>vanity</i> and <i>self-sufficiency</i> to interfere
in matters which were out of their sphere. They considered,
moreover, that to pursue more than one avocation would
be detrimental to their own interests, and those of the community
at large; and that, when men, from a motive of avarice,
engage in numerous branches of art, the general result is, that
they are unable to excel in any. If any artisan interfered in
political matters, or engaged in any employment other than the
one to which he had been brought up, a severe punishment
was immediately inflicted upon him.</p>

<p>The eminent German hierologist, Dr. Lepsius, now employed
in Egypt by the Prussian government, after mentioning, in
a recent letter, the many discoveries he had made of ancient
ruins, tombs, &amp;c., writes as follows:</p>

<p>“With the exception of about twelve, which belong to a later
period, all these tombs were erected contemporaneously with, or
soon after, the building of the great pyramid, and consequently
their dates throw an invaluable light on the study of human
civilization in the most remote period of antiquity. The <i>sculptures</i>
in relief are surprisingly numerous, representing whole
figures, some the size of life, and others of various dimensions.
The <i>paintings</i> are on back grounds of the finest chalk. They
are numerous and beautiful beyond conception&mdash;<i>as fresh and
perfect as if finished yesterday</i>! The pictures and sculptures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
on the walls of the tombs, represent, for the most part,
scenes in the lives of the deceased persons, whose wealth in
cattle, fish-boats, servants, &amp;c., is ostentatiously displayed before
the eye of the spectator. All this gives an insight into the details
of private life among the ancient Egyptians. By the help
of these inscriptions I think I could, without difficulty, make a
“Court Calendar” of the reign of King Cheops<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. In some instances
I have traced the graves of father, son, grandson, and
even great-grandson&mdash;all that now remains of the distinguished
families, which five thousand years ago, formed the nobility of
the land.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_127" href="#FNanchor_127" class="label">[127]</a> We do not find in these researches, that the ancients were acquainted with
the arts of spinning and weaving glass, or of giving it any required shade of color.
This invention, therefore, must be considered as belonging to the nineteenth century,
and the honor of the discovery is due to M. Dubus Bonnel, an ingenious
Frenchman, a native of Lille, and for which he obtained patents in Great Britain,
and various countries of the European continent in 1837.</p>

<p>“When we figure to ourselves an apartment decorated with cloth of glass, and
resplendent with lights, we must be convinced that it will equal in brilliancy all
that the imagination can conceive; and realise, in a word, the wonders of the
enchanted palaces mentioned in the Arabian tales. The lights flashing from the
polished surface of the glass, to which any color or shade may be given, will
make the room have the appearance of an apartment composed of pearls, mother-of-pearl,
diamonds, garnets, sapphires, topazes, rubies, emeralds, or amethysts,
&amp;c., or, in short, of all those precious stones united and combined in a thousand
ways, and formed into stars, rosettes, boquets, garlands, festoons, and graceful undulations,
varied almost ad infinitum.”&mdash;L’Echo du Monde Savant, &amp;c. No. 58,
Feb. 15, 1837.&mdash;<i>Translated from the French.</i></p>

<p>The warp is composed of silk, forming the body and groundwork on which
the pattern in glass appears, as effected by the weft. The requisite flexibility of
glass thread for manufacturing purposes is to be ascribed to its extreme fineness;
as not less than from fifty to sixty of the original threads (spun by steam engine
power) are required to form one thread of the weft. The process is slow; for no
more than a yard of cloth can be produced in twelve hours. The work, however,
is extremely beautiful and comparatively cheap, inasmuch as no similar stuff,
where bullion is really introduced, can be purchased for anything like the price
for which this is sold; added to this, it is, as far as the glass is concerned, imperishable.
Glass is more durable than either gold or silver, and, besides, possesses
the advantage of never tarnishing.</p>

<p>It can never be too strongly impressed upon a mind anxious
for the acquisition of knowledge, that the commonest things by
which we are surrounded are deserving of minute and careful
attention. The most profound investigations of Philosophy are
necessarily connected with the ordinary circumstances of our
being, and of the world in which our every-day life is spent.
With regard to our own existence, the pulsation of the heart,
the act of respiration, the voluntary movement of our limbs,
the condition of sleep, are among the most ordinary operations
of our nature; and yet how long were the wisest of men struggling
with dark and bewildering speculations before they could
offer anything like a satisfactory solution of these phenomena,
and how far are we still from an accurate and complete knowledge
of them! The science of Meteorology, which attempts
to explain to us the philosophy of matters constantly before our
eyes, as dew, mist, and rain, is dependent for its illustrations
upon a knowledge of the most complicated facts, such as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
influence of heat and electricity upon the air; and this knowledge
is at present so imperfect, that even these common occurrences
of the weather, which men have been observing and
reasoning upon for ages, are by no means satisfactorily explained,
or reduced to the precision that every science should aspire
to. Yet, however difficult it may be entirely to comprehend
the phenomena we daily witness, everything in nature is full
of instruction. Thus the humblest flower of the field, although,
to one whose curiosity has not been excited, and whose understanding
has, therefore, remained uninformed, it may appear
worthless and contemptible, is valuable to the botanist, not
only with regard to its place in the arrangement of this portion
of the Creator’s works, but as it leads his mind forward to the
consideration of those beautiful provisions for the support of
vegetable life, which it is the part of the physiologist to study
and admire<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

St. 1845.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>This train of reasoning is peculiarly applicable to the economy
of insects. They constitute a very large and interesting
part of the animal kingdom. They are everywhere about us.
The <i>spider</i> weaves his curious web in our houses; the <i>caterpillar</i>
constructs his silken cell in our gardens; the <i>wasp</i> that
hovers over our food has a nest not far removed from us, which
she has assisted to build with the nicest art; the <i>beetle</i> that
crawls across our path is also an ingenious and laborious mechanic,
and has some curious instincts to exhibit to those who
will feel an interest in watching his movements; and the <i>moth</i>
that eats into our clothes has something to plead for our pity, for
he came, like us, naked into the world, and he has destroyed
our garments, not in malice or wantonness, but that he may
clothe himself with the same wool which we have stripped from
the sheep. An observation of the habits of these little creatures
is full of valuable lessons, which the abundance of the
examples has no tendency to diminish. The more such observations
are multiplied, the more we are led forward to the freshest
and the most delightful parts of knowledge; the more do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
we learn to estimate rightly the extraordinary provisions and
most abundant resources of a creative Providence; and the better
do we appreciate our own relations with all the infinite varieties
of Nature, and our dependence, in common with the
<i>ephemeron</i> that flutters its little hour in the summer sun, upon
that Being in whose scheme of existence the humblest as well
as the highest creature has its destined purposes. “If you
speak of a <i>stone</i>,” says St. Basil, “if you speak of a <i>fly</i>, a
<i>gnat</i>, or a <i>bee</i>, your conversation will be a sort of demonstration
of his power whose hand formed them, for the wisdom of
the workman is commonly perceived in that which is of little
size. He who has stretched out the Heavens, and dug up the
bottom of the sea, is also He who has pierced a passage through
the sting of the bee for the ejection of its poison.”</p>

<p>If it be granted that making discoveries is one of the most
satisfactory of human pleasures, then we may without hesitation
affirm, that the study of insects is one of the most delightful
branches of natural history, for it affords peculiar facilities
for its pursuit. These facilities are found in the almost inexhaustible
variety which insects present to the curious observer.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no situation in which the lover of nature
and the observer of animal life may not find opportunities for
increasing his store of facts. It is told of a state prisoner under
a cruel and rigorous despotism, that when he was excluded
from all commerce with mankind, and was shut out from books,
he took an interest and found consolation in the visits of a
<i>spider</i>; and there is no improbability in the story. The operations
of that persecuted creature are among the most extraordinary
exhibitions of mechanical ingenuity; and a daily
watching of the workings of its instinct would beget admiration
in a rightly constituted mind. The poor prisoner had
abundant leisure for the speculations in which the spider’s web
would enchain his understanding. We have all of us, at one
period or other of our lives, been struck with some singular
evidence of contrivance in the economy of insects, which we
have seen with our own eyes. Want of leisure, and probably
want of knowledge, have prevented us from following up the
curiosity which for a moment was excited. And yet some such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
accident has made men Naturalists, in the highest meaning of
the term. Bonnet, evidently speaking of himself, says, “I
knew a naturalist, who, when he was seventeen years of age,
having heard of the operations of the ant-lion, began by doubting
them. He had no rest till he had examined into them; and
he verified them, he admired them, he discovered new facts, and
soon became the disciple and the friend of the Pliny of
France<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>” (Réaumur). It is not the happy fortune of many to
be able to devote themselves exclusively to the study of nature,
unquestionably the most fascinating of human employments;
but almost every one may acquire sufficient knowledge to be
able to derive a high gratification from beholding the more common
operations of animal life. His materials for contemplation
are always before him.</p>

<p>The silk-worm is a species of caterpillar which, like all other
insects of the same class, undergoes a variety of changes during
the short period of its life; assuming, in each of three successive
transformations, <i>a form wholly dissimilar to that with
which it was previously invested</i>.</p>

<p>Among the great variety of caterpillars, the descriptions of
which are to be found in the records of natural history, the
silk-worm occupies a place far above the rest. Not only is our
attention called to the examination of its various transformations,
by the desire of satisfying our curiosity as entomologists,
but our artificial wants incite us likewise to the study of its nature
and habits, that we may best and most profitably apply its
instinctive industry to our own advantage.</p>

<p>It has been well observed by Pullein, a writer on this subject,
that “there is scarcely anything among the various wonders
which the animal creation affords, more admirable than the
variety of changes which the silk-worm undergoes;” but the
curious texture of that silken covering with which it surrounds
itself when it arrives at the perfection of its animal life, vastly
surpasses what is made by other animals of this class. All the
caterpillar kind do, indeed, pass through changes like those of
the silk-worm, and the beauty of many in their butterfly state
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
greatly exceeds it; but the covering which they put on before
this mutation is poor and mean, when compared to that golden
tissue in which the silk-worm wraps itself. They, indeed, come
forth in a variety of colors, their wings bedropped with gold
and scarlet, yet are they but the beings of a summer’s day;
both their life and beauty quickly vanish, and they leave no
remembrance after them; but the silk-worm leaves behind it
such beautiful, such beneficial monuments, as at once to record
both the wisdom of their Creator and his bounty to man.”</p>

<p>We may without impropriety, here introduce the following
truly beautiful comparison of the shortness of human life, as
well as in illustration of this part of our subject, as evidenced
in the May-fly.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="label">[130]</a> “See,” exclaims Linnæus, “the large, elegant painted wings of the butterfly,
four in number, covered with delicate feathery scales! With these it sustains
itself in the air a whole day, rivalling the flight of birds and the brilliancy of the
peacock. Consider this insect through the wonderful progress of its life,&mdash;how
different is the first period of its being from the second, and both from the parent
insect! Its changes are an inexplicable enigma to us: we see a green caterpillar,
furnished with sixteen feet, feeding upon the leaves of a plant; this is changed
into a chrysalis, smooth, of golden lustre, hanging suspended to a fixed point,
without feet, and subsisting without food; this insect again undergoes another
transformation, acquires wings, and six feet, and becomes a gay butterfly, sporting
in the air, and living by suction upon the honey of plants. What has Nature
produced more worthy of our admiration than such an animal coming upon the
stage of the world, and playing its part there under so many different masks?”
The ancients were so struck with the transformations of the butterfly, and its revival
from a seeming temporary death, as to have considered it an emblem of the
soul, the Greek word <i>psyche</i> signifying both the soul and a butterfly; and it is
for this reason that we find the butterfly introduced into their allegorical sculptures
as an emblem of immortality. Trifling, therefore, and perhaps contemptible,
as to the unthinking may seem the study of a butterfly, yet when we consider
the art and mechanism displayed in so minute a structure,&mdash;the fluids circulating
in vessels so small as almost to escape the sight&mdash;the beauty of the wings
and covering&mdash;and the manner in which each part is adapted for its peculiar
functions,&mdash;we cannot but be struck with wonder and admiration, and allow,
with Paley, that “the production of beauty was as much in the Creator’s mind in
painting a butterfly as in giving symmetry to the human form.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Silk-worms proceed from eggs which are deposited during the
summer by a grayish kind of moth, of the genus palæna.
These eggs are about equal in size to a grain of mustard seed:
their color when first laid is yellow; but in three or four days
after, they acquire a bluish cast. In temperate climates, and
by using proper precautions, these eggs may be preserved during
the winter and spring, without risk of premature hatching.
The period of their animation may be accelerated or retarded
by artificial means, so as to agree with the time when the natural
food of the insect shall appear in ample abundance for its
support.</p>

<p>All the curious changes and labors which accompany and
characterize the life of the silk-worm are performed within the
space of a very few weeks. This period varies, indeed, according
to the climate or temperature in which its life is passed; all
its vital functions being quickened, and their duration proportionally
abridged, by warmth. With this sole variance, its progressions
are alike in all climates, and the same mutations accompany
its course.</p>

<p>The three successive states of being put on by this insect
are, that of the worm or caterpillar, of the chrysalis or aurelia,
and moth. In addition to these more decided transformations,
the progress of the silk-worm in its <i>caterpillar state</i> is marked
by <i>five distinct stages of being</i>.</p>

<p>When first hatched, it appears as a small black worm about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
a quarter of an inch in length. Its first indication of animation
is the desire which it evinces for obtaining food, in search of
which, if not immediately supplied, it will exhibit more power
of locomotion than characterizes it at any other period. So
small is the desire of change on the part of these insects, that
of the generality it may be said, their own spontaneous will
seldom leads them to travel over a greater space than three
feet throughout the whole duration of their lives. Even when
hungry, the worm still clings to the skeleton of the leaf from
which its nourishment was last derived. If, by the continued
cravings of its appetite, it should be at length incited to the effort
necessary for changing its position, it will sometimes wander
as far as the edge of the tray wherein it is confined, and
some few have been found sufficiently adventurous to cling to
its rim; but the smell of fresh leaves will instantly allure them
back. It would add incalculably to the labors and cares of
their attendants, if silk-worms were endowed with a more rambling
disposition. So useful is this peculiarity of their nature,
that one is irresistibly tempted to consider it the result of design,
and a part of that beautiful system of the fitness of things,
which the student of natural history has so many opportunities
of contemplating with delight and admiration.</p>

<p>In about eight days from its being hatched, its head becomes
perceptibly larger, and the worm is attacked by its first sickness.
This lasts for three days; during which time it refuses food,
and remains motionless as in a kind of lethargy. Some have
thought this to be sleep, but the fatal termination which so
frequently attends these sicknesses seems to afford a denial to this
hypothesis. The silk-worm increases its size so considerably,
and in so short a space of time,&mdash;its weight being multiplied
many thousand fold in the course of one month,&mdash;that if only
one skin had been assigned to it, which should serve for its
whole caterpillar state, it would with difficulty have distended
itself sufficiently to keep pace with the insect’s growth. The
economy of nature has therefore admirably provided the embryos
of other skins, destined to be successively called into use;
and this sickness of the worm, and its disinclination for food,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
may very probably be occasioned by the pressure of the skin,
now become too small for the body which it encases.</p>

<p>At the end of the third day from its first refusal of food, the
animal appears, on that account, much wasted in its bodily
frame; a circumstance which materially assists in the painful
operation of casting its skin: this it now proceeds to accomplish.
To facilitate this moulting, a sort of humor is thrown off by the
worm, which, spreading between its body and the skin about to
be abandoned, lubricates their surfaces, and causes them to
separate the more readily. The insect also emits from its body
silken traces, which, adhering to the spot where it rests, serves
to confine the skin to its then existing position. These preliminary
steps seem to call for some considerable exertion, as after
them the worm remains quiet for a short space of time, to recover
from its fatigue. It then proceeds, by rubbing its head
among the leafy fibres surrounding it, to disencumber itself of
the scaly covering. Its next effort is to break through the skin
nearest to the head, which, as it is there the smallest, calls for the
greatest exertion; and no sooner is this accomplished and the
two front legs are disengaged, than the remainder of the body
is quickly drawn forth, the skin being still fastened to the spot
in the manner already described.</p>

<p>This moulting is so complete, <i>that not only is the whole
covering of the body cast off, but that of the feet, the entire
skull, and even the jaws, including the teeth</i>. These several
parts may be discerned by the unassisted eye; but become very
apparent when viewed through a magnifying lens of moderate
power.</p>

<p>In two or three minutes from the beginning of its efforts the
worm is wholly freed, and again puts on the appearance of
health and vigor; feeding with recruited appetite upon its leafy
banquet. It sometimes happens that the outer skin refuses to
detach itself wholly, but breaks and leaves an annular portion
adhering to the extremity of its body, from which all the struggles
of the insect cannot wholly disengage it. The pressure
thus occasioned induces swelling and inflammation in other
parts of the body; and, after efforts of greater or less duration,
death generally terminates its sufferings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Worms newly freed from their exuviæ are easily distinguished
from others by the pale color and wrinkled appearance of their
new skin. This latter quality, however, soon disappears,
through the repletion and growth of the insect, which continues
to feed during five days. At this time its length will be increased
to half an inch; when it is attacked by a second sickness,
followed by a second moulting, the manner of performing
which is exactly similar to the former. Its appetite then again
returns, and is indulged during other five days, in the course of
which time its length increases to three quarters of an inch: it
then undergoes its third sickness and moulting. These being
past in all respects like the former, and five more days of feeding
having followed, it is seized by its fourth sickness, and casts
its skin for the last time in the caterpillar state. The worm is
now about one and a half or two inches long. This last change
being finished, the worm devours its food most voraciously, and
increases rapidly in size during ten days.</p>

<p>The silk-worm has now attained to its full growth, and is a
slender caterpillar from two and a half to three inches in length
(See Figure 1. <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III.</a>). The peculiarities of its structure
may be better examined now than in its earlier stages. It can
readily be seen that the worm has twelve membranous rings
round its body, parallel to each other; and which, answering to
the movements of the animal, mutually contract and elongate.
It has sixteen legs, in pairs: six in front, which are covered
with a sort of shell or scale, and are placed under the three first
rings, and cannot be either sensibly lengthened, or their position
altered. The other ten legs are called holders: these are membranous,
flexible, and attached to the body under the rings, being
furnished with little hooks, which assist the insect in
climbing. The skull is inclosed in a scaly substance, similar to
the covering of the first six legs. The jaws are indented or
serrated like the teeth of a saw, and their strength is great considering
the size of the insect. Its mouth is peculiar, having a
vertical instead of an horizontal aperture; and the worm is furnished
with eighteen breathing holes, placed at equal distances
down the body, nine on each side. Each of these holes is supposed
to be the termination of a particular organ of respiration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
On either side of the head, near to the mouth, seven small eyes
may be discerned. The two broad appearances higher upon
the head, which are frequently mistaken for eyes, are bones of
the skull. The two apertures through which the worm draws
its silken filament are placed just beneath the jaw, and close to
each other; these being exceedingly minute.</p>

<p>At the period above-mentioned the desire of the worm for
food begins to abate: the first symptom of this is the appearance
of the leaves nibbled into small portions and wasted. It
soon after entirely ceases even to touch the leaves; appears
restless and uneasy; erects it head; and moves about from side
to side, with a circular motion, in quest of a place wherein it
can commence its labor of spinning. Its color is now light
green, with some mixture of a darker hue. In twenty-four
hours from the time of its abstaining from food, the material
for forming its silk will be digested in its reservoirs; its green
color will disappear; its body will have acquired a degree of
glossiness, and have become partially transparent towards its
neck. Before the worm is quite prepared to spin, its body will
have acquired greater firmness, and be in a trifling measure
lessened in size.</p>

<p>“The substance,” says Mr. Porter, “of which the silk is
composed, <i>is secreted in the form of a fine yellow transparent
gum in two separate vessels of slender dimensions, wound,
as it were, on two spindles in the stomach; and if unfolded,
these vessels would be about ten inches in length</i><a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.” This
statement is proved to be erroneous, as the reader will perceive,
at the conclusion of this chapter.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>When the worm has fixed upon some angle, or hollow place,
whose dimensions agree with the size of its intended silken
ball or cocoon, it begins its labor by throwing forth thin and irregular
threads, see Figure 2. <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III.</a>, which are intended to
support its future dwelling.</p>

<p>During the first day, the insect forms upon these a loose
structure of an oval shape, which is called floss silk, and within
which covering, in the three following days, it forms the firm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
and consistent yellow ball; the laborer, of course, always remaining
on the inside of the sphere which it is forming<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">[132]</a> If at this time any of the threads intended for the support of the cocoon
should be broken, the worm will find, in the progress of its work, that the ball,
not being properly poised, becomes unsteady, so that the insect is unable properly
to go forward with its labors. Under these circumstances the worm pierces and
altogether quits the unfinished cocoon, and throws out its remaining threads at
random wherever it passes; by which means the silk is wholly lost, and the
worm, finding no place wherein to prepare for its change, dies without having
effected it. It may sometimes happen, but such a thing is of unfrequent occurrence,
that the preparatory threads before mentioned are broken by another
worm working in the neighborhood, when the same unsatisfactory result will be
experienced.&mdash;<i>Obs. on the Culture of Silk</i>, <i>by</i> <span class="smcap">A. Stephenson</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>The silken filament, which when drawn out appears to be
one thread, is composed of two fibres, unwound through the
two orifices before described; and these fibres are brought together
by means of two hooks, placed within the silk-worm’s
mouth for the purpose. The worm rests on its lower extremity
throughout the unwinding operation, and employs its mouth
and front legs in the task of directing and uniting the two filaments.
The filament is not wound in regular concentric circles
round the interior surface of the ball, but in spots, going backwards
and forwards with a sort of wavy motion. This apparently
irregular manner of proceeding is plainly perceptible
when the silk is being reeled off the ball; which does not make
more than one or two entire revolutions while ten or twelve
yards of silk are being transferred to the reel<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="label">[133]</a> Mr. Robinet, of Paris, made the following curious calculation on the movements
a silk-worm must make in forming a cocoon supposed to contain a thread
of 1500 metres. It is known, says Mr. Robinet, that the silk-worm, in forming
his cocoon, does not <i>spin</i> the silken filament in concentric circles round the interior
surface of the ball, but in a zigzag manner. This it effects by the motions of
its head. Now if each one of these motions gives half a centimetre of the silken
filament; it follows that the worm must make 300,000 motions of its head to
form it; and if the labor requires 72 hours in the performance, the creature
makes 100,000 motions every 24 hours, 4,166 per hour, 69 per minute, and a little
more than one in a second!</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>At the end of the third or fourth day, the worm will have
completed its task; and we have then a <i>silk cocoon</i> (See Figure
3. <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III.</a>), with the worm imprisoned in its centre; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
cocoon being from an inch to an inch and a half long, and of a
yellow or orange color.</p>

<p>When the insect has finished its labor of unwinding, it
smears the entire internal surface of the cocoon with a peculiar
kind of gum, very similar in its nature to the matter which
forms the silk itself; and this is no doubt designed as a shield
against rain or the humidity of the atmosphere, for the chrysalis
in its natural state; when of course it would be subject to
all varieties of weather. The silken filament of which the
ball is made up, is likewise accompanied, throughout its entire
length, by a portion of gum, which serves to give firmness and
consistency to its texture; and assists in rendering the dwelling
of the chrysalis impervious to moisture. This office it performs
so well, that when, for the purpose of reeling the silk
with greater facility, the balls are thrown into basins of hot
water, they swim on the top with all the buoyancy of bladders;
nor, unless the ball be imperfectly formed, does the water
penetrate within until the silk is nearly all unwound. In figure
4, <a href="#Plate_III">plate III.</a>, the cocoons are drawn two-thirds of the usual
size, and are shown with part of the outward floss silk removed.</p>

<p>The continual emission of the silken material during the
formation of its envelope, together with its natural evaporation,
uncompensated by food, causes the worm gradually to contract
in bulk; it becomes wrinkled, and the rings of its body approach
nearer to each other and appear more decidedly marked.
When the ball is finished, the insect rests awhile from its toil,
and then throws off its caterpillar garb. If the cocoon be now
opened, its inhabitant will appear in the form of a chrysalis or
aurelia, in shape somewhat resembling a kidney-bean (See Figure
5. <a href="#Plate_III">plate III.</a>), but pointed at one end, having a smooth brown
skin. Its former covering, so dissimilar to the one now assumed,
will be found lying beside it.</p>

<p>The account which has been given of the progressions of the
silk-worm shows, that, in its various modifications, <i>the animal
organization of the insect has been always tending towards
its simplification</i>. Count Dandolo, writing upon this subject,
observes, “Thus the caterpillar is in the first instance composed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of animal, silky, and excremental particles; this forms the state
of the <i>growing caterpillar</i>: in the next stage it is composed
of animal and silky particles; it is then the <i>mature caterpillar</i>:
and lastly, it is reduced to the animal particles alone; and
is termed in this state the <i>chrysalis</i>. The poet Cowper, in
the following lines, beautifully illustrates this subject:</p>

</div>

<p>It has been already noticed that the progressions of the insects
are accelerated by an increase of temperature; and some
variation will equally be experienced where different modes of
treatment are followed; and, in particular, where different
periods of the year are chosen in which to produce and rear the
worm. Malpighius, in his “Anatomy of the Silk-worm,” says,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
that worms which he hatched in May were eleven days old ere
they were attacked by their first sickness; others hatched in
July were ten days, and those brought forth in August nine days,
before they refused their food, preparatory to their first moulting.
Eight days appear to be the most usual term for their first attack;
and by his judicious treatment count Dandolo shortened
even this term by two days. In Europe, except where recourse
is had to artificial aid, the term of the caterpillar state is usually
that which has been already mentioned.</p>

<p>Sudden transitions from cold to heat, or vice versa, are highly
injurious to the silk-worm; but it can bear a very high degree
of heat, if uniformly maintained, without sustaining injury.
Count Dandolo observed, that “the greater the degree of heat
in which it is reared, the more acute are its wants, the more
rapid its pleasures, and the shorter its existence.” Monsieur
Boissier de Sauvagues made many experiments on this point.
One year, when by the early appearance of the mulberry
leaves, which were developed by the end of April, he was
forced to hurry forward the operations of his filature, he raised
the heat of the apartment in which the newly-hatched worms
were placed to 100°; gradually diminishing this during their
first and second ages to 95°. In consequence of the animal excitement
thus induced, there elapsed only nine days between
the hatching and the second moulting inclusively. It was the
general opinion of those cultivators who witnessed the experiment,
that the insects would not be able to exist in so intensely
heated an atmosphere. The walls of the apartment, and the
wicker hurdles on which the worms were placed, could scarcely
be touched from the great heat, and yet all the changes and
progressions went forward perfectly well, and a most abundant
crop of silk was the result.</p>

<p>The same gentleman, on a subsequent occasion, exposed his
brood to the temperature of 93° to 95° during their first age;
of 89° to 91° in the second age; and remarked that the attendant
circumstances were the same as in his former experiment,
the changes of the worm being performed in the same
space of time; whence he came to the conclusion, that it is not
practicable to accelerate their progress beyond a certain point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
by any superadditions of heat. In both of these experiments
the quantity of food consumed, was as great as is usually given
during the longer period employed in the common manner of
rearing. After the second moulting had taken place in the
last experiment, the temperature was lowered to 82°; and it is
remarkable that the worms occupied only five days in completing
their third and fourth changes, although others which had
been accustomed to this lower degree from their birth occupied
seven or eight days for each of these moultings. It would therefore
seem that the constitution of the insects can be affected,
and an impetus given to their functions at the period of their
first animation, which accompanies them through their after
stages. So far from this forcing system proving injurious to the
health of silk-worms, M. de Sauvagues found that his broods
were unusually healthy; and that while the labors of cultivation
were abridged in their duration, much of the attendant
anxiety was removed.</p>

<p>Like other caterpillars, the silk-worm is not a warm-blooded
animal, and its temperature is therefore always equal to that of
the atmosphere in which it is placed. In the silk-producing
countries, where modes of artificial heating have not been
studied practically and scientifically, the difficulty and expense
that must attend the prosecution of this heating system, form
abundant reasons why it cannot be generally adopted. The
great susceptibility of the insect to atmospheric influences
would also in a great degree render unsuitable the more common
arrangements for the purpose. The plan of warming
apartments by means of stoves, in its passage through which
the air becomes highly heated before it mixes with and raises
the general temperature of the air in the chamber, is liable to
this inconvenience,&mdash;that the portion so introduced, having its
vital property impaired by the burning heat through which it
has passed, injures, proportionably, the respirable quality of the
whole atmosphere; an effect which is easily perceptible by
those who inhale it. A better plan of heating has lately been
suggested, and is rapidly coming into practice, viz., of warming
buildings by a current of hot water (an American invention),
which is, by a very simple process, kept constantly flowing in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
close channels through the apartment, where it continually
gives off its heat by radiation; and the degree of this being
far below the point which is injurious to the vital quality of
air, the evil before alluded to is avoided. If the expense of fuel
be not too great, as compared with that of the labor which
would be saved by this invention, the adoption in silk countries
of such a mode of raising and regulating the temperature
might, probably, prove advantageous.</p>

<p>The silk-worm remains in the form of a chrysalis, for periods
which, according to the climate or the temperature wherein it
may be placed, vary from fifteen to thirty days. In India, the
time is much shorter (See <a href="#Chapter1_VII">Chapter VIII</a>.); in Spain and Italy,
eighteen to twenty days. In France three weeks; and in the
climate of England, when unaccelerated by artificial means,
thirty days will elapse from the time the insect begins to spin
until it emerges in its last and perfect form. It then throws off
the shroud which had confined it in <i>seeming lifelessness</i>, and
appears as a large moth of a grayish-white color, furnished with
four wings, two eyes, and two black horns or antlers which
present a feathery appearance (See Figure 6. <a href="#Plate_III">plate III.</a>).</p>

<p>If left until this period within the cocoon, the moth takes
immediate measures for its extrication: ejecting from its mouth
a liquor with which it moistens and lessens the adhesiveness
of the gum wherewith it had lined the interior surface of its
dwelling, and the insect is enabled, by frequent motions of its
head, to loosen, without breaking, the texture of the ball; then
using its hooked feet, it pushes aside the filaments and makes
a passage for itself into light and freedom. It is erroneously
said that the moth recovers its liberty by gnawing the silken
threads; but it is found, on the contrary, that if carefully unwound,
their continuity is by this means rarely broken.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable circumstances connected with
the natural history of silk-worms, is the degree in which their
bulk and weight is increased, and the limited time wherein
that increase is attained. Count Dandolo, who appears to
have neglected nothing that could tend to the right understanding
of the subject, and to the consequent improvement
of the processes employed, had patience enough to count and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
weigh many hundred thousand eggs, as well as follow out to
the ultimate result his inquiries respecting their produce. He
found that on an average sixty-eight sound silk-worm’s eggs
weighed one grain. One ounce<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>, therefore, comprised, 39,168
eggs. But one twelfth part of this weight evaporates previous
to hatching, and the shells are equal to one fifth more. If,
therefore, from one ounce, composed of 576 grains, 48 grains be
deducted for evaporation, and 115 for the shells, 413 grains
will remain equal to the weight of 39,168 young worms; and,
at this rate, 54,526 of the insects when newly hatched, are
required to make up the ounce. After the first casting of the
skin, 3840 worms are found to have this weight, so that the
bulk and weight of the insects have in a few days been multiplied
more than <i>fourteen times</i>. After the second change 610
worms weigh an ounce, their weight being increased in the intermediate
time six fold. In the week passed between the second
and third ages, the number of insects required to make up
the same weight, decreases from 610 to 144, their weight being
therefore more than quadrupled. During the fourth age,
a similar rate of increase is maintained: thirty-five worms now
weigh an ounce. The fifth age of the caterpillar comprises
nearly a third part of its brief existence, and has been described,
by an enthusiastic writer on the subject, as the happiest
period of its life, during which it rapidly increases in size, preparing
and secreting the material it is about to spin. When
the silk-worms are fully grown, and have arrived at their period
of finally rejecting food, six of them make up the weight of
an ounce. They have, therefore, since their last change, again
added to their weight <i>six fold</i>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="label">[134]</a> This ounce contains 576 grains; 8.5325 of these grains equal seven grains
troy. One ounce avoirdupoise is therefore equal to about 533 grains, and between
11-12 and 11-13 ounce avoirdupoise equals one of the above ounces.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>It is thus seen that, in a few short weeks, the insect has
multiplied its weight more than <i>nine thousand fold</i>! From
this period, and during the whole of its two succeeding states
of being, the worm imbibes no nourishment, and gradually diminishes
in weight; being supported by its own substance, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
appearing to find sufficient occupation in forming its silken web,
and providing successors for our service, without indulging that
grosser appetite which forms the beginning and the end of their
desires during their caterpillar existence.</p>

<p>The moth enjoys its liberty for only a very brief space. Its
first employment is to seek its mate; after which the female
deposits her eggs; and both in the course of two or three days
after, end their being.</p>

<p>Formation of Silk. By M. H. Straus, of Durckheim.&mdash;“It
is generally admitted by naturalists that the thread of the
caterpillar is produced by a simple emission of liquid matter
through the orifice of the spinner, and that it acquires solidity
at once from the drying influence of the air. It was easy to
entertain such an hypothesis, for nothing is more simple than
the formation of a very fine thread by such a process. But a
little reflection will soon show us, even <i>à priori</i>, that it is not
possible; for how can we comprehend that so fine a fibre, liquid
at the instant of its issue from the aperture, should <i>instantly</i>
acquire such a consistence as to bear the weight of the animal
suspended by it, and at the same time that it is rapidly produced?
Though the fluid, holding the silk in solution, should
be quickly volatilised, it must still be a matter of conjecture,
how the animal suspended by this thread could be able to arrest
its issue, holding on only by the thread itself, for it cannot
pinch the thread, seeing that it is only in a liquid state inside,
and the thread cannot be glued to the edge of the opening, as
its rapid adhesion would prevent its issue while the animal is
spinning. A little examination would satisfy us that silk cannot
be produced in this manner, but that it is secreted in the
<i>form of silk</i> in the silk vessels, and that the spinning apparatus
<i>only winds it</i>. The thread is produced in the slender posterior
part of the vessel, the inflated portion of which consists
of the reservoir of ready formed silk, where it is found in the
form of a skein; each thread being rolled up so as to occupy
in the silk-worm (<i>Bombex mori</i>) a space of only about a sixth
part of the real length of the skein. The fact is shown by the
following experiment I made for the purpose of ascertaining
whether the silk is formed in the body of the caterpillars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>‘<i>Take one of the animals when about to form its cocoon,
clean it in common vinegar, in which it may remain from
four to six hours, open it on the back and extract the silk
vessels, there being one on each side of the alimentary canal.
Take them up by the hinder end, just where they begin to
swell (further back the silk is not solid enough), and draw
them out. The membrane forming the vessel is easily torn
open, and the contents expand to six or seven times its original
length. The skein having attained its full length by
the letting out of its gathers, we obtain a cord perfectly equal
in size throughout, except at the end, where it is attenuated.</i>
This cord resembles a large horse-hair, and constitutes what
fishermen call “<i>Florence hair</i>.” I ought to add that in simply
drawing out the silk vessel, the Florence hair is found enveloped
in a golden yellow gummy matter, forming the glutinous
portion by which the worm fastens its thread. This must be
got rid of by drawing the cord through the fold formed on the
inside of the joint of the left fore finger, converted into a canal
by applying to it the end of the thumb. The glutinous substance
and the membranes being thus separated, we have the
<i>naked hair</i>. In this state, before the silk becomes dry and
hard, not only will it be indefinitely divided longitudinally,
which proves its fibrous structure, but in trying to split it by
drawing it transversely, <i>the little filaments of silk which form
it are perfectly separated</i>, making <i>a bundle of extremely fine
fibrils</i>.’</p>

<p>We cannot better conclude this interesting portion of our
subject, than by quoting the following beautiful lines by Miss
H. F. Gould:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>In China, the tradition of the silk culture is, as already
shown, carried back into the mythological periods, and dates
with the origin of agriculture itself. These two pursuits or
avocations, namely, husbandry and the silk-manufacture, form
the subject of one of the sixteen discourses to the people. It
is there observed, that “from ancient times the Son of Heaven
directed the plough: the Empress planted the mulberry-tree.
Thus have these exalted personages, not <i>above</i> the practice of
labor and exertion, set an example to all men, with a view to
leading the millions of their subjects to attend to their essential
interests.”</p>

<p>In the work published by Imperial authority, entitled “Illustrations
of Husbandry and Weaving<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>,” there are numerous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
wood-cuts, accompanied by letter-press explanatory of the different
processes of farming and the silk-manufacture. The
former head is confined to the production of rice, the staple article
of food, and proceeds from the ploughing of the land to
the packing of the grain; the latter details all the operations
connected with planting the mulberry and gathering its leaves,
up to the final weaving of the silk.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="Footnote_135" href="#FNanchor_135" class="label">[135]</a> The drawing, <a href="#Plate_I">plate I.</a> (Frontispiece) is a faithful copy of a loom represented
in this curious work. For this representation of a Chinese weaving engine, as
well as several translations, explanatory of the silk-manufacture, &amp;c., we are indebted
to Walter Lowry, Esq., Sec. to the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions
in this city; who kindly permitted us to copy it from the original plate,
forming a part of the interesting work above referred to, which is composed of
seventy-five volumes, and was, as we understand, presented to the Board by a
New York merchant. Many of the illustrations are extremely beautiful, reflecting
the highest credit upon the artisans of the “Celestial Empire.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>The mulberry-tree is chiefly cultivated in Chĕ-kiang, which
province, together with the only three others that produce fine
silk, namely, Kiang-nân, Woo-pĕ, and Sze-chuen, is crossed by
the <i>thirtieth</i> parallel of latitude. Chĕ-kiang is a country
highly alluvial, intersected by numerous rivers and canals, with
a climate that corresponds pretty nearly to the same latitude as
that in the United States of America. The soil is manured
with mud, dug from the rivers, assisted with ashes or dung;
and the spaces between the trees are generally filled with millet,
pulse, or other articles of food. The time for pruning the
young trees, so as to produce fine leafy shoots, is at the commencement
of the year. About four eyes are left on every
shoot, and care is taken that the branches be properly thinned,
with a view to giving plenty of light and air to the leaves. In
gathering these, they make use of steps, as the young trees
could not support a ladder, and would besides be injured in their
branches by the use of one. The trees, with their foliage, are
carefully watched, and the mischiefs of insects prevented by
the use of various applications, among which are some essential
oils.</p>

<p>The young trees of course suffer by being stripped of their
leaves, which are the <i>lungs</i> of plants, and this is an additional
reason for renewing them after a certain time. They endeavor
in part to counteract the evil effect, by pruning and lopping
the tree, so as to diminish the wood when the leaves have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
been gathered. It is surprising, however, to observe how soon
a tree in those climates will recover its leaves in the summer or
autumn, after having been entirely stripped of them by a typhoon
or hurricane. Fresh plants are procured by cuttings or
layers, and sometimes from seed. When the trees grow too
old for the production of the finest leaves, and show a greater
tendency to fruiting, they are either removed or so cut and
managed as to produce young branches.</p>

<p>The principal object, in the cultivation of the mulberry, is to
produce the greatest quantity of young and healthy leaves
without fruit. For this reason the trees are not allowed to exceed
a certain age and height. They are planted on the plan
of a quincunx<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, and said to be in perfection in about three
years.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136" class="label">[136]</a> In <i>gardening</i>, the <i>quincunx</i> order is a plantation of trees disposed in a
square, consisting of five trees, one at each corner and a fifth in the centre, which
order repeated indefinitely, forms a regular grove or wood, viewed by an angle of
the square or parallelogram, presents equal or parallel alleys.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Mr. Barrow, who observed the management of the trees and
silk-worms in Chĕ-kiang, confirms the usual Chinese accounts,
by saying that “the houses in which the worms are reared are
placed generally in the centre of each plantation, in order that
they may be removed as far as possible from every kind of
noise; experience having taught them that a sudden shout, or
the bark of a dog, is destructive of the young worms. A
whole brood has sometimes perished from the effects of a thunder-storm.”</p>

<p>Some notion of the extent of the care required in the management
of the worms may be formed from the following extract,
taken from the Chinese work referred to at the beginning
of this chapter.</p>

<p>“The place where their habitation is built must be retired,
free from noise, smells, and disturbances of every kind. The
least fright, makes great impressions on these sensitive creatures;
even the barking of dogs, &amp;c., is capable of throwing
them into the utmost disorder.</p>

<p>For the purpose of paying them every attention an affectionate
mother is provided, who is careful to supply their wants;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
she is called <i>Isan-mon</i>, ‘mother of the worms.’ She takes
possession of the chamber, but not before she has washed herself
and put on clean clothes, which have not the least repulsive
smell; she must not have eaten anything immediately before,
or handled any wild succory, the smell of which is very
prejudicial. She must be clothed in a plain habit, without any
lining, that she may be more sensible of the warmth of the
place, and accordingly increase or lessen the fire. She must
also carefully avoid making a smoke or raising a dust, which
would also be offensive.”</p>

<p>Silk-worms require to be carefully humored before the time
of casting their slough. Every day is to them a year, having
in a manner, the four seasons; the morning being the Spring;
the middle of the day: Summer; the evening: Autumn; and
the night, Winter.</p>

<p>The chambers are so contrived as to admit of the use of artificial
heat when necessary. Great care is taken of the sheets
of paper on which the eggs have been laid; and the hatching
is either retarded or advanced, by the application of cold or heat
according to circumstances, so as to time the simultaneous exit
of the young worms exactly to the period when the tender
spring-leaves of the mulberry are most fit for their nourishment.</p>

<p>They proportion the food very exactly to the young worms
by weighing the leaves, which in the first instance are cut, but
as the insects become larger, are given to them whole. The
greatest precautions being observed in regulating the temperature
of the apartments. The worms are fed upon a species of
small hurdles of basket-work, strewed with leaves, which are
constantly shifted for the sake of cleanliness, the insects readily
moving off to a fresh hurdle with new leaves, as the scent attracts
them. In proportion to their growth, room is afforded to
them by increasing the number of these hurdles, the worms of
one being shifted to three, then to six, and so on until they attain
their greatest size. When they have cast their several
skins, reached their greatest size, and assumed a transparent
yellowish color, they are removed to places divided into compartments,
preparatory to casting forth their silken filaments.</p>

<p>In the course of a week after the commencement of this operation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the cocoons are complete, and it now becomes necessary
to take them in hand before the pupæ turn into <i>moths</i>,
which would immediately bore their way out, and spoil the cocoons.
When a certain number, therefore, have been laid aside
for the sake of future eggs, the chrysalides are killed by being
placed in jars under layers of salt and leaves, with a complete
exclusion of air. They are subsequently placed in moderately
warm water, which dissolves the glutinous substance that binds
the silk together, and the filament is wound off upon reels.
This is put up in bundles of a certain size and weight, and
either becomes an article of merchandise under the name of
“raw silk,” or is subjected to the loom, and manufactured into
various stuffs, for home or foreign consumption. The Chinese
notwithstanding the simplicity of their looms (see <a href="#Plate_I">frontispiece</a>),
will imitate <i>exactly</i> the newest and most elegant patterns from
France. They particularly excel in the production of <i>damasks</i>,
<i>figured-satins</i>, and <i>embroidery</i>. Their crape has never yet
been perfectly imitated; and they make a species of washing
silk, called at Canton “ponge,” which, the longer it is used, the
softer it becomes.</p>

<p>The Chinese have from time immemorial been celebrated for
the beauty of their embroideries; indeed, it has been doubted
whether the art was not originally introduced into Europe by
them, through the Persians.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it is evident that the raising of the
<i>mulberry-tree</i> should first engage the attention of the cultivator,
since its leaves form the almost exclusive nourishment of
the silk-worm. It is scarcely necessary that we should in a
work of this description enter more fully into the cultivation of
the mulberry-tree. This has already been so ably done by
Jonathan Cobb, Esq. of Dedham, Mass., Dr. Pascalis of New
York, Judge Comstock of Hartford, Conn., and E. P. Roberts,
Esq. of Baltimore, as to leave no stone unturned, or any want
upon the subject.</p>

<p>In such parts of the Chinese empire where the climate is favorable
to the practice, and where alone, most probably, the
silk-worm is indigenous, it remains at liberty, feeding on the
leaves of its native mulberry-tree, and going through all its mutations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
among the branches, uncontrolled by the hand and unassisted
by the cares of man. As soon, however, as the silken
balls have been constructed, they are appropriated by the universal
usurper, who spares only the few required to reproduce
their numbers, and thus furnish him with successive harvests<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="label">[137]</a> Mons. Marteloy of Montpelier, who made many experiments upon the rearing
of silk-worms, presented a memorial upon the subject to the French minister,
in compliance with whose recommendation, a few silk growers of Languedoc
caused an experiment to be publicly made in the open air, in the garden belonging
to the Jesuits’ college at Montpelier. The whole was placed under the direction
of Mons. Marteloy, who had 1200 livres assigned to him to defray the necessary
expenses. The experiment succeeded perfectly. This was in 1764. In
the following year a second trial was made, and 1800 livres were set apart for
the expenses. Owing, however, to the unfavorable nature of the season, this experiment
failed entirely, the heavy and incessant rains making it impossible to
keep the food of the worms in a sufficiently dry state. The rearing of silk-worms
in the open air was not again attempted in that quarter; but the partial success
led to the adoption among cultivators of a better system of ventilation, and the
production of silk was about this time very much extended throughout Languedoc.&mdash;<i>Obs.
on the Culture of Silk</i>, <i>by</i> <span class="smcap">A. Stephenson</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>This silk, the spontaneous offering of nature, is not, however,
equal in fineness to that produced by worms under shelter, and
whose progressions are influenced by careful management.
Much attention is, therefore, bestowed by the Chinese in the
artificial rearing of silk-worms. One of their principal cares,
is to prevent the too early hatching of the eggs, to which the
nature of the climate so strongly disposes them. The mode
of insuring the requisite delay, is, to cause the moth to deposit
her eggs on large sheets of paper: these, immediately upon
their production, are suspended from a beam in the room, while
the windows are opened to expose them to the air. In a few
days the papers are taken down and rolled loosely up with the
eggs inside, in which form they are again hung during the
remainder of the summer and autumn. Towards the end of
the year they are immersed in cold water wherein a small portion
of salt has been dissolved. In this state the eggs are left
during two days; and on being taken from the salt and water
are first hung to dry, and then rolled up rather more tightly
than before, each sheet of paper being thereafter inclosed in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
separate earthen vessel. Some persons, who are exceedingly
particular in their processes, use a lye made of mulberry-tree
ashes, and place the eggs likewise, during some minutes, on
snow-water.</p>

<p>These processes appear efficacious for checking the hatching,
until the expanding leaves of the mulberry-tree give notice to
the silk-worm-rearer that he may take measures for bringing
forth his brood. For this purpose the rolls of paper are taken
from the earthen vessels, and hung up towards the sun, the
side to which the eggs adhere being turned from its rays, by
being placed inside, and thus allowing the heat to be transmitted
to them through the paper. In the evening the sheets are
rolled closely up and placed in a warm situation. The same
proceeding is repeated on the following day, when the eggs assume
a grayish color. On the evening of the third day, after
a similar exposure, they are found to be of a much darker color,
nearly approaching to black; and the following morning, on
the paper being unrolled, they are covered with worms. In the
higher latitudes the Chinese have recourse to the heat of stoves,
in order to promote the simultaneous hatching of the eggs.</p>

<p>The apartments in which the worms are kept stand in dry
situations, in a pure atmosphere, and apart from all noise, which
is thought to be annoying to the worms, especially when they
are young. The rooms are made very close, but adequate
means of ventilation provided: the doors being open to the
south. Each chamber is provided with nine or ten rows of
frames, placed one above the other. On these frames, rush
hurdles are ranged; upon which the worms are fed through
their five ages. A uniform degree of heat is constantly preserved,
either by means of stoves placed in the corners of the
apartments, or by chafing-dishes which from time to time are
carried up and down the room. Flame and smoke being always
carefully avoided: cow-dung dried in the sun is preferred
by the Chinese to all other kinds of fuel for this purpose.</p>

<p>The most unremitting attention is paid to the wants of the
worms, which are fed night and day. On their being hatched
they are furnished with forty meals for the first day, thirty are
given on the second day, and fewer on and after the third.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
The Chinese believe that the growth of silk-worms is accelerated,
and their success promoted by the abundance of their
food, and therefore, in cloudy and damp weather, when the
insects are injuriously affected by the state of the atmosphere,
their appetites are stimulated by a wisp of very dry straw being
lighted and held over them, thus causing the cold and damp
air to be dissipated.</p>

<p>The Chinese calculate that the same number of insects
which would, if they had attained the full size in twenty-three
or twenty-four days, produce twenty-five ounces of silk, would
give only twenty ounces if their growth occupied twenty-eight
days, and only ten ounces if forty days. In order, therefore, to
accelerate their growth, they supply them with fresh food every
half-hour during the first day of their existence, and then gradually
reduce the number of meals as the worms grow older.
It deserves to be remarked as a fact unnoticed in Natural Theology,
that the substance on which this valuable caterpillar
feeds, is the leaf of the mulberry-tree; and Providence, as if to
ensure the continuance of this useful species, has so ordained
it that no other insect will partake of the same food; thus ensuring
a certain supply for the little spinster.</p>

<p>Many persons believe that light is injurious to silk-worms;
but, so far from this opinion being correct, the opposite belief
would probably be nearer to the truth. In its native state, the
insect is of course exposed to light, and suffers no inconvenience
on that account; and it has been observed by one who gave
much attention to the subject (Count Dandolo), that in his
establishment, “on the side on which the sun shone directly
on the hurdles, the silk-worms were stronger and more numerous
than in those places where the edge of the wicker hurdle
formed a shade.” The obscurity wherein the apartments are
usually kept has a very pernicious influence on the air: the
food of the worms emits in light oxygen, or vital air, while in
darkness it exhales carbonic acid gas, unfit for respiration.
This well-known fact occurs alike with all leaves similarly
circumstanced<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. To the bad effects thus arising from the exclusion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
of the sun’s rays, another evil is added by the nature
of the artificial lights employed, being such as still further to
vitiate the air.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_138" href="#FNanchor_138" class="label">[138]</a> “There is in the order of nature a certain, and very surprising fact; when
the leaves of vegetables are struck by the sun’s rays, they exhale an immense
quantity of vital air necessary to the life of animals, and which they consume by
respiration.</p>

<p>“These same leaves in the shade as well as in darkness exhale an immense
quantity of mephitic or fixed air, which cannot be inhaled without destruction of
life.</p>

<p>“This influence of the sun does not cease even when the leaf has been recently
gathered; on the contrary, in darkness, gathered leaves will exhale a still greater
quantity of mephitic air.</p>

<p>“Place one ounce of fresh mulberry leaves in a wide-necked bottle of the size
of a Paris pint, containing two pounds of liquid; expose this bottle to the sun;
about an hour afterwards, according to the intensity of the sun, reverse the bottle
and introduce a lighted taper in it; this done, the light will become brighter,
whiter, and larger, which proves that the vital air contained in the bottle has increased
by that which has disengaged itself from the leaves: to demonstrate this
phenomenon more clearly, a taper may be put in a similar bottle, that only contains
the air which has entered into it by its being uncorked. Shortly after the
first experiment, water will be found in the bottle which contained the mulberry
leaves; this water, evaporating from the leaves by means of the heat, hangs on
the sides, and runs to the bottom when cooling; the leaves appear more or less
withered and dry according to the liquid they have lost. In another similar bottle
place an ounce of leaves, and cork it exactly like the former; place it in obscurity,
either in a box, or wrap it in cloths, in short, so as totally to exclude
light; about two hours after, open the bottle, and put either a lighted taper or a
small bird into it; the candle will go out, and the bird will perish, as if they had
been plunged into water, which demonstrates that in darkness the leaves have
exhaled mephitic air, while in the sun they exhaled vital air”.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Count Dandolo’s</span>
<i>Treatise on the Art of Rearing Silk-worms</i>, <i>p.</i> 144.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>An almost incredible quantity of fluid is constantly disengaged
by evaporation from the bodies of the insects; and if
means be not taken to disperse this as it is produced, another
cause of unwholesomeness in the air arises. Noticing this,
Count Dandolo observes, “This series of causes of the deterioration
of the air which the worms must inhale, may be termed
a continual conspiracy against their health and life; and their
resisting it, and living throughout shows them to have great
strength of constitution.”</p>

<p>In seven days from the commencement of the cocoons they
are collected in heaps; those which are designed to continue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the breed being first selected and set apart on hurdles, in a
dry and airy situation. The next care, is to destroy the vitality
of the chrysalides in those balls which are to be reeled.
The most approved method of performing this, is to fill large
earthen vessels with cocoons, in layers, throwing in one-fortieth
part of their weight of salt upon each layer, covering the whole
with large dry leaves resembling those of the water-lilly, and
then closely stopping the mouths of the vessels. In reeling
their silk the Chinese separate the thick and dark from the
long and glittering white cocoons, as the produce of the former
is inferior.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Dr. Ure for the two following articles
(<i>extracted from the Journal of the Asiatic Society, for January,
1837</i>), on wild silk-worms. The first article is from the
pen of Thomas Hugon, a resident of Nowgong, and relates to
wild silk-worms of Assam.</p>

<p>“The Assamese select for breeding, such cocoons only as have
been begun to be formed in the largest number on the same
day, usually the second or third after the commencement;
those which contain males being distinguishable by a more
pointed end. They are put in a closed basket suspended from
the roof; the moths, as they come forth, having room to move
about, at the expiration of a day, the females (known only by
their large body) are taken out, and tied to small wisps of
thatching-straw, selected always from over the hearth, its darkened
color being thought more acceptable to the insect. If out
of a batch, there should be but few males; the wisps with the
females tied to them are exposed outside at night; and the
males thrown away in the neighborhood, find their way to
them. These wisps are hung upon a string tied across the
roof, to keep them from vermin. The eggs laid after the first
three days, are said to produce weak worms. The wisps are
taken out morning and evening, and exposed to the sun, and
in ten days after being laid, a few of them are hatched. The
wisps being then hung up to the tree, the young worms find
their way to the leaves. The ant, whose bite is fatal to the
worm in its early stages, is destroyed by rubbing the trunk of
the tree with molasses, and tying dead fish and toads to it, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
attract these rapacious insects in large numbers, when they are
destroyed with fire; a process which needs to be repeated several
times. The ground under the trees is also well cleared, to
render it easy to pick up and replace the worms which fall
down. They are prevented from coming to the ground, by
tying fresh plantain-leaves round the trunk, over whose slippery
surface they cannot crawl; and then transferred from
exhausted trees to fresh ones, on bamboo platters tied to long
poles. The worms require to be constantly watched and protected
from the depredations of both day and night birds, as
well as rats and other vermin. During their moultings, they
remain on the branches; but when about beginning to spin,
they come down the trunk, and being stopped by the plantain-leaves,
are there collected in baskets, which are afterwards put
under bunches of dry leaves, suspended from the roof, into
which the worms crawl, and form their cocoons&mdash;several being
clustered together: this accident, owing to the practice of crowding
the worms, which is most injudicious, rendering it impossible
to wind off their silk in continuous threads, as in the filatures
of Italy, France, and even Bengal. The silk is, therefore,
spun like flax, instead of being unwound in single filaments.
After four days the proper cocoons are selected for the next
breed, and the rest are reeled. The total duration of a breed
varies from sixty to seventy days; divided into the following
periods:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Breed Duration">
<tr><td>Four moultings, with one day’s illness attending each,</td>
  <td class="tdr">20</td>

<p>“On being tapped with the finger, the body renders a hollow
sound; the quality of which shows whether they have come
down for want of leaves on the tree, or from their having ceased
feeding.</p>

<p>“As the chrysalis is not soon killed by exposure to the sun,
the cocoons are put on stages, covered with leaves, and exposed
to the hot air from grass burned under them; they are next
boiled for about an hour in a solution of the potash, made from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
incinerated rice-stalks; then taken out and put on a cloth folded
over them to keep them warm. The floss being removed by
hand, they are then thrown into a basin of hot water to be unwound;
which is done in a very rude and wasteful way.</p>

<p>“The plantations for the mooga silk-worm in Lower Assam,
amount to 5000 acres, besides what the forests contain; and
yield 1500 maunds of 84 lbs. each per annum. Upper Assam
is more productive.</p>

<p>“The cocoon of the <i>Koutkuri mooga</i> is of the size of a
fowl’s egg. It is a wild species, and affords filaments much
valued for fishing-lines.</p>

<p>“The <i>Arrindy</i>, or <i>Eria</i> worm, and moth, is reared over a
great part of Hindostan, but entirely within doors. It is fed
principally on the <i>Hera</i>, or <i>Palma christi</i> leaves, and gives
sometimes 12 broods of spun silk in the course of a year. It
affords a fibre which looks rough at first; but when woven,
becomes soft and silky, after repeated washings. The poorest
people are clothed with stuff made of it, which is so durable as
to descend from mother to daughter. The cocoons are put in
a close basket, and hung up in the house, out of reach of rats
and insects. When the moths come forth, they are allowed to
move about in the basket for twenty-four hours; after which
the females are tied to long reeds or canes, twenty or twenty-five
to each, and then hung up in the house. Of the eggs
that are laid the first three days, about 200, only are kept;
then tied up for seed. When a few of the worms are hatched,
the cloths are put on small bamboo platters hung up in the
house, in which they are fed with tender leaves. After the
second moulting, they are removed to bunches of leaves suspended
above the ground, beneath which a mat is laid to receive
them when they fall. When they cease to feed, they are
thrown into baskets full of dry leaves, among which they form
their cocoons, two or three being often discovered joined together.</p>

<p>“The <i>Saturnia trifenestrata</i> has a yellow cocoon of a remarkably
silky lustre. It lives on the soom-tree in Assam, but
seems not to be much used.”</p>

<p>The second article is from the pen of Dr. Helfer, upon those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
wild silk-worms which are indigenous to India. Besides the
<i>Bombyx mori</i>, the Doctor enumerates the following seven species,
formerly unknown:&mdash;1. “The wild silk-worm of the central
provinces, a moth not larger than the <i>Bombyx mori</i>.” 2.
“The Joree silk-worm of Assam, <i>Bombyx religiosæ</i>, which
spins a cocoon of a fine filament, with much lustre. It lives
upon the pipul tree (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>), which abounds in India,
and ought therefore to be turned to account in breeding this
valuable moth.” 3. “<i>Saturnia silhetica</i>, which inhabits the
cassia mountains in Silhet and Dacca, where its large cocoons
are spun into silk.” 4. “A still larger <i>Saturnia</i>, one of the
greatest moths in existence, measuring <i>ten inches</i> from the <i>one
end of the wing to the other</i><a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>; observed by Mr. Grant, in
<i>Chirra punjee</i>”. 5. “<i>Saturnia paphia</i>, or the Tusseh silk-worm,
is the most common of the native species, and furnishes
the cloth usually worn by Europeans in India. It has not
hitherto been domesticated, but millions of its cocoons are annually
collected in the jungles, and brought to the silk factories
near Calcutta and Bhagelpur. It feeds most commonly on the
hair-tree (<i>Zizyphus jujuba</i>), but it prefers the <i>Terminalia alata</i>,
or Assam tree, and the <i>Bombax heptaphyllum</i>. It is called
<i>Koutkuri mooga</i>, in Assam.” 6. “Another <i>Saturnia</i>, from
the neighborhood of Comercolly.” 7. “<i>Saturnia assamensis</i>,
with a cocoon of a yellow-brown color, different from all others,
called <i>mooga</i>, in Assam; which, although it can be reared in
houses, thrives best in the open air upon trees, of which seven
different kinds afford it food. The <i>Mazankoory mooga</i>, which
feeds on the Adakoory tree, produces a fine silk, which is nearly
white, and fetches 50 per cent. more than the fawn colored.
The trees of the first year’s growth produce by far the most
valuable cocoons. The mooga which inhabits the soom-tree,
is found principally in the forests of the plains, and in the villages.
The tree grows to a large size, and yields three crops
of leaves in the year. The silk is of a light fawn color, and
ranks next in value to the Mazankoory. There are generally
five breeds of mooga worms in the year; 1. In January and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
February; 2. In May and June; 3. In June and July; 4. In
August and September; 5. In October and November; the first
and last being the most valuable.”</p>

<p>Dr. Anderson informs us, that in Madras the silk-worm goes
through all its evolutions in the short space of twenty-two days.
It appears, however, that the saving of time, and consequently
labor, is the only economy resulting from the acceleration; as
the insects consume as much food during their shorter period of
life, as is assigned to the longer-lived silk-worms of Europe.</p>

<p>We extract the following paper, with slight emendations,

<p>“As requested, I forward you a sketch of Mr. Gill’s cradle
for feeding silk-worms, (It is not necessary for us to give
a drawing of it in a work like the present, which is chiefly
intended for the general reader, and besides, this machine
is already sufficiently known to silk culturists.) I have five
patches of mulberry, (in all, ten or twelve acres,) two parcels
of which you have seen. The one adjoining my garden, by
estimation, may furnish foliage sufficient for a million and
a half of worms. The mulberries consist of the white, black,
alpine, broosa, moretta, alata, multicaulis, Asiatic, and large-leaf
Canton. The two latter I prefer for my own use&mdash;the
Canton for early feeding with foliage, and the Asiastic for
branch feeding. The Canton is highly approved of for producing
heavy and firm cocoons, which, by competent testimony
and experiments, have been found in favor of the Canton feed
as five to eight, and is the true species used by the Chinese,
as testified by a resident Missionary, the Rev. E. C. Bridgman,
and more recently by Dr. Parker, while on his late visit
to the United States. I consider the peanut variety of worms
the best for producing the most silk of a good quality.</p>

<p>“From an elevated plat near my cocoonery, you had a view
of our extensive meadows spread out at the foot of Mount Holyoke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
My cocoonery you have examined, with its fixtures for
feeding silk-worms&mdash;the mode of open feeding, ventilator, and
ventilating cradles. Since you left, the whole has been completed,
with hammocks suspended over the cradles, easily put in
motion, and so constructed that no offal can drop into the cradles
beneath, nor interfere with the rocking motion or winding; the
arrangement is much admired, and estimated to accommodate
half a million of worms, or more, to be fed simultaneously.
About half of the cocoonery has hurdles of lattice work, covered
in part with gauze netting four feet wide and the same
number of tiers in height. The cocoonery is supposed to be
sufficiently open on the sides, ends, and roof, to admit a free
circulation of pure air. The flooring is the natural earth.</p>

<p>“The past winter has been uncommonly severe on grape-vines
and fruit; forest and mulberry trees; the Asiatic I found the
most hardy of any other, and the Canton the earliest in foliage.
On the 21st and 22d of May there were severe frosts, destroying
garden vegetables, and injuring some early mulberry foliage;
added to this, ice was formed in many places. The accounts
from Vermont and New Hampshire are so disastrous as to delay
early feeding; while in Northampton, June 14, at one of my
plantations, you saw silk-worms in the act of winding, and
others in a good state of forwardness. On the day of your departure,
I received a letter from a distant silk grower, a staunch
promoter of the <i>one early</i> and <i>open</i> crop system, that, on account
of the unpropitious season and condition of his trees, he
would delay fetching out his worms until the last of June, and
then make his great effort upon one crop.</p>

<p>“To provide against premature hatching of silk-worms, or the
disaster of an early frost, it is advisable to have foliage gathered
and dried the year preceding; which, being pulverized and
moistened with water, may be given to the worms until new
foliage appears; and they will eat it freely.</p>

<p>“To obtain the most and best foliage of the mulberry, it will
be necessary every Spring to cut or head them down within
three or four inches of the ground, and preserve the stalks for
<i>bark-silk</i>. I have a quantity of them saved with bark peeled
from the large Asiatics to be used for making <i>bark-silk</i>, in addition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
to a quantity of mulberry-leaves preserved for making
paper. The whole process, although not carried out, as yet, in
this country, with either, has been successfully accomplished in
France, from proof shown by M. Frassinet. I am endeavoring
to have it tested here, by subjecting both stalk and peeled
bark to the operation of steaming with soap and water, to facilitate
the separation of the bark from the wood, and the outside
cuticle from the fibrous substance of the bark, before trying the
operation of the brake for dressing, carding, spinning, &amp;c.
Should it prove successful, it will be made public (See Mr.
Zinke’s process, <a href="#Chapter1_XI">Chapter XI.</a>). Hopes are entertained that
what has been done may be done again; that Yankee ingenuity
and perseverance may prove a match for foreign cheap labor(?).</p>

<p>“The present time has been called the age of invention and
improvement. But if ”there is nothing new under the sun”
(a pretty fair illustration of this assertion of the wise man&mdash;Vide
Ecclesiastes i. 9, 10.&mdash;will be found in this work.); and
if what is, has been and may be again, then may we hope to
be benefitted by the reproduction of astonishing results in all
coming time; and even now, while there has been anxious inquiry
for some easy mode to separate the bark of the mulberry
from the wood, an <i>historical fact</i> has been recently communicated(?);
by which, some two hundred and forty years ago, in
the year 1600, an accident occurred, which resulted in the
manufacture of a handsome fabric from the fibrous bark of the
mulberry, with the inference that the bark had been previously
used for the manufacture of cordage, on account of the superior
strength of the fibrous bark over that of other materials
used for cordage<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p>“Under date of June 6, 1844, I have been favored with a letter
from the president of one of the most eminent literary institutions
of our country, who expresses his opinion of the progress
of silk culture as follows:</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
<p>‘I am gratified to find a renewed and more general interest
excited at the present time. If this awaking up to a scientific
and practical consideration of the subject is not soon crowned
with signal success, I am satisfied it will not be for want of
enterprize or skill in our countrymen, but merely from the high
price of labor, compared with the scanty wages given in other
silk-growing countries. Even this consideration (though it
may retard for a while the complete success of this department
of productive industry), will not prevent its ultimate triumph.’</p>

<p>“The above is the opinion of one of the most scientific men
of the age, who, in early life, was himself a silk grower. His
opinion accords with that of many others of high consideration
in the United States.</p>

<p>“While viewing the flourishing condition of one of my mulberry
patches, you asked with what it had been manured? and
received for answer, <i>ashes</i>, and the <i>deciduous foliage</i>. The
foliage, you thought, could be gathered for making <i>paper</i>, and
answered, that there would be sufficient defective foliage left to
manure the land; the foliage is richer than any stable manure,
and stable manure should never be applied to the mulberry. I
have not had occasion the last five or six years to use even
ashes as a manure, but keep the land in good tilth by frequent
hoeing. If you found these mulberries more flourishing than
others you had seen, it may be attributed, in a great measure,
to frequent hoeing, and dressing with the decayed mulberry
foliage.</p>

<p>“The soil is a light sandy loam; and, previous to its being
stocked with mulberry, would not yield the value of $10 in any
crop; and now, my feeder says, if his worms do well, he hopes
to get $800 for the crop! A part of this lot being stocked with
alpine, broosa, and Asiatic mulberry, of 6 to 10 feet in height,
in rows 3 feet apart; and having grown so vigorously as to
shade each other, and liable to have spotted leaves. I have, in
order to avoid this, and procure more, larger, and better foliage,
cut away or headed down every other row, within three or four
inches of the ground; and from the stumps have sprung up a
multitude of thrifty sprouts, now fit for use, and the leaves three
times larger than those on the standard trees, are so fresh and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
tender, that in some measure it is hoped, they may answer the
purpose of seedling foliage, so highly recommended by M. Frassinet,
who has the following encomium on <i>seedling</i> foliage:
‘that 100 pounds of such foliage is worth near 200 pounds of
old leaves to make the same quantity of cocoons; or in fact,
equivalent in value to nearly double the stock of other foliage.’
I have caused considerable bark to be stripped from the Asiatic
trees cut away for manufacturing purposes; and M. Rouviere,
of Lyons, has proved that the bark of young shoots, submitted
to the same process as hemp, yields abundant silk-fibre to make
beautiful tissues (noticed at the close of Chapter XI.). I should
advise silk growers to preserve the shoots, have them barked
in the best way, and the silky fibre rotted, carded, spun, and
wove. M. Rouviere asserts that it will be not only fine and
strong, but take the most beautiful colors. Of the bark, ropes
and nets are made in the Morea, and may be applied to great
advantage in the manufacture of paper, together with the
foliage.</p>

<p>“The Canton and Asiatic seed sown this year are in a flourishing
condition for plantation use, exclusive of several mulberry
plantations which will be for rent, or growing silk on shares,
next spring. Up to the first of July, worms have been uncommonly
healthy&mdash;the probable effect of more open ventilation
than in former years.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dabney, consul at Fayal, (now in Boston) has two millions
of worms at present on feed. S. Whitmarsh, at Jamaica,
has 360 of what he calls <i>creolized native</i> eggs, in constant
feed, which go through the whole course to the cocoon in 24
days. The eggs hatch in 10 days after being laid. He has
received the silk report, and made such improvement as to
save, in all, nine-tenths of the usual labor. The silk cause at
Jamaica occasions great interest in England for its prosperity

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let us fancy that some thousand years ago, a mortal, wandering through an
oriental wood, saw a worm falling from a fruit-bearing tree&mdash;that he found this
little creature had reached the end of one of its stages of existence, and was laboriously
engaged in shrouding itself in an unknown substance, like a fine thread of
gold, out of which it constructed its tomb; that, attracted by the circumstance,
he found this shroud to consist of a thread hundreds of yards long, which a very
little attention enabled him to detach; he found he could strengthen the threads
by uniting them together, and they could be applied to various purposes of usefulness;
he thought of winding off the thread; the reel lends him the first assistance,
but he could not make the reel without the co-operation of a knife, or some such
instrument with a sharp edge. Thus the aid of art&mdash;of the produce of art&mdash;is
already called in. With this rude instrument he makes a machine which enables
him to reel off the thread coffin of the curious animal. In process of time, he
finds that this fine filament can be applied to the making of garments&mdash;garments
alike useful and ornamental. Now trace the progress of things by which, from
the narrow sphere of his observation and experiment, his success spreads through
the districts he inhabits, and from them to other lands, and becomes an object of
importance to communicate with the whole family of man. By and by the cocoon,
or its produce, finds its way to foreign countries, probably more enlightened
than his own, again to be operated on by a higher intelligence and more practised
skill. This associates the thread of the silk-worm with a ship, with ship-building,
and all its marvellous combinations.&mdash;Some wandering merchant probably conveyed
the raw material to Persia; some adventurous mariner to Greece or Italy,
or other regions where it gave a new impulse to science and to thought. But
consider for a moment, before the ship was launched upon the water, how many
elements were necessary for its production; think of how multitudinous and various
the materials which that ship required for its construction, before the products
of that remote country are brought to their ultimate markets for manufacture.
I refer to this particular topic, because it is associated with the prosperity
of the districts in which we are, and I wished to carry back your thoughts to the
germ whence that prosperity sprung.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bowring’s</span> <i>Lecture at the Poplar Institution</i>.</p>

<p>Of spiders there are many species; most of them extend
their labors no farther than merely to make a web to ensnare
and detain their food. But others are known to go beyond
this, and spin a bag in the form of a cocoon, for the protection
of their eggs, nearly similar to that of the silk-worm.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Modern naturalists do not rank spiders among insects, because
they have no antennæ, and no division between the head
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
and shoulders. They breathe by leaf-shaped gills, situated under
the belly, instead of spiracles in the sides; and have a heart
connected with these. But as spiders are popularly considered
insects, it will sufficiently suit our purpose to introduce them
here as such.</p>

<p>Spiders are usually classed according to their difference of
color, whether black, brown, yellow, &amp;c., or sometimes by the
number and arrangement of their eyes: of these organs some
possess no fewer than ten, others eight, and others again six<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Some species of spiders are known to possess the power of not
merely forming a web, but also of spinning, for the protection
of their eggs, a bag somewhat similar in form and substance
to the cocoon of the silk-worm. The apparatus by which they
construct their ingenious fabrics, is much more complicated
than that which is common to the various species of caterpillars.
Caterpillars have only two reservoirs for the materials
of their silk; but the spider spins minute fibres from fine papillæ,
or small nipples placed in the hinder part of its body. These
papillæ serve the office of so many wire-drawing machines, from
which the silken threadlets are ejected. Spiders, according to
the dissections of M. Treviranus, have four principal vessels,
two larger and two smaller, with a number of minute ones at
their base. Several small tubes branch towards the reservoirs,
for carrying to them, no doubt, a supply of the secreted material.
Swammerdam describes them as twisted into many coils
of an agate color<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. We do not find them coiled, but nearly
straight, and of a deep yellow color. From these, when broken,
threads can be drawn out like those spun by the spider,
though we cannot draw them so fine by many degrees.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>From these little flasks or bags of gum, situated near the
apex of the abdomen, and not at the mouth as in caterpillars,
a tube originates, and terminates in the external spinnerets,
which may be seen by the naked eye in the form of five little
teats surrounded by a small circle, as represented in Fig. 8.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
<a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV.</a>; this figure shows the garden spider (<i>Epeira diadema</i>)
suspended by a thread proceeding from its spinneret.</p>

<p>We have seen that the thread of the silk-worm is composed
of two filaments united, but the spider’s thread would appear,
from the first view of its five spinnerets, to be quintuple, and in
some species which have six teats, so many times more. It is not
safe, however, in our interpretations of nature to proceed upon
conjecture, however plausible, nor to take anything for granted
which we have not actually seen; since our inferences in such
cases are almost certain to be erroneous. If Aristotle, for example,
had ever looked narrowly at a spider when spinning, he
could not have fancied, as he does, that the materials which it
uses are nothing but wool stripped from its body. On looking,
then, with a strong magnifying glass, at the teat-shaped spinnerets
of a spider, we perceive them studded with regular rows
of minute bristle-like points, about a thousand to each teat,
making in all from five to six thousand. These are minute
tubes which we may appropriately term <i>spinnerules</i>, as each
is connected with the internal reservoirs, and emits a thread
of inconceivable fineness. Fig. 9. represents this wonderful
apparatus as it appears in the microscope.</p>

<p>We do not recollect that naturalists have ventured to assign
any cause for this very remarkable multiplicity of the spinnerules
of spiders, so different from the simple spinneret of caterpillars.
To us it appears an admirable provision for their mode
of life. Caterpillars neither require such strong materials, nor
that their thread should dry as quickly. It is well known in
our manufactures, particularly in rope-spinning, that in cords
of equal thickness, those which are composed of many smaller
ones united are stronger than those spun at once. In the instance
of the spider’s thread, this principle must hold still more
strikingly, inasmuch as it is composed of fluid materials that
require to be dried rapidly, and this drying must be greatly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
facilitated by exposing so many to the air separately before
their union, which is effected at about the tenth of an inch
from the spinnerets. In Fig. 10. <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV</a>. each of the threads
shown is represented to contain one hundred minute threads,
the whole forming only one of the spider’s common threads.
In the figure the threads are, of course, greatly magnified, so
that, for the small space represented, the lines are shown as
parallel. The threadlets, or filaments as they come from the
papillæ, are too fine to be counted with any degree of accuracy,
but it is evident that very many are sent forth from each of the
larger papillæ. This fact tends to explain the power possessed
by the spider of producing threads having different degrees of
tenuity. By applying more or less of these papillæ against the
place whence it begins its web, the spider joins into one thread
the almost imperceptible individual filaments which it draws
from its body; the size of this thread being dependent on the
number of nipples employed, and regulated by that instinct
which teaches the creature to make choice of the degree of
exility most appropriate to the work wherein it is about to
engage.</p>

<p>Réaumur relates that he has often counted as many as seventy
or eighty fibres through a microscope, and perceived that there
were yet infinitely more than he could reckon; so that he believed
himself to be far within the limit of truth in computing
that the tip of <i>each</i> of the five papillæ furnished 1000 separate
fibres: thus supposing that one slender filament of a spider’s
web is made up of 5000 fibres!</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoeck, in one of his extraordinary microscopical observations
on a young spider, not bigger than a grain of sand,
upon enumerating the threadlets in one of its threads, calculated
that it would require <i>four millions</i> of them to be as thick
as a hair of his head!</p>

<p>Another important advantage derived by the spider from the
multiplicity of its threadlets is, that the thread affords a much
more secure attachment to a wall, a branch of a tree, or any
other object, than if it were simple; for, upon pressing the
spinneret against the object, as spiders always do when they fix
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
a thread, the spinnerules are extended over an area of some
diameter, from every hair’s breadth of which a strand, as rope-makers
term it, is extended to compound the main cord. Fig.
11. <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV</a>. exhibits, magnified, this ingenious contrivance.
Those who may be curious to examine it, will see it best when
the line is attached to any black object, for the threads, being
whitish, are, in otherwise, not so easily perceived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shooting of the lines.</span>&mdash;It has long been considered a
curious though difficult investigation, to determine in what
manner spiders, seeing that they are destitute of wings, transport
themselves from tree to tree, across brooks, and frequently
through the air itself, without any apparent starting point. On
looking into the authors who have treated upon this subject,
it is surprising how little there is to be met with that is new,
even in the most recent. Their conclusions, or rather their
conjectural opinions, are, however, worthy of notice; <i>for by
unlearning error, we the more firmly establish truth</i>.</p>

<p>1. One of the earliest notions upon this subject is that of
Blancanus, the commentator on Aristotle, which is partly
adopted by Redi, by Henricus Regius of Utrecht, by Swammerdam<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>,
by Lehmann, as well as by Kirby and Spence<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. “The
spider’s thread,” says Swammerdam, “is generally made up of
two or more parts, and after descending by such a thread, it ascends
by one only, and is thus enabled to waft itself from one
height or tree to another, even across running waters; the
thread it leaves loose behind it being driven about by the wind,
and so fixed to some other body.” “I placed,” says Kirby,
“the large garden spider (<i>Epeira diadema</i>) upon a stick about
a foot long, set upright in a vessel containing water....
It let itself drop, not by a single thread, but by <i>two</i>, each distant
from the other about the twelfth of an inch, guided, as usual,
by one of its hind feet, and that one apparently smaller than
the other. When it had suffered itself to descend nearly to the
surface of the water, it stopped short, and by some means,
which I could not distinctly see, broke off, close to the spinners,
the smallest thread, which still adhering by the other end to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the top of the stick, floated in the air, and was so light as to be
carried about by the slightest breath. On approaching a pencil
to the loose end of this line, it did not adhere from mere contact.
I, therefore, twisted it once or twice round the pencil, and
then drew it tight. The spider, which had previously climbed
to the top of the stick, immediately pulled at it with one of its
feet, and finding it sufficiently tense, crept along it, strengthening
it as it proceeded by another thread, and thus reached the
pencil.”</p>

<p>1. “We have repeatedly witnessed this occurrence,” says Mr.
Rennie, “in the fields, and when spiders were placed for experiment,
as Kirby has described; but we very much doubt that
the thread broken is ever intended as a bridge cable, or that it
would have been so used in that instance, had it not been artificially
fixed and again accidentally found by the spider. According
to our observations, a spider never for an instant, abandons,
the thread which she dispatches in quest of an attachment,
but uniformly keeps trying it with her feet, in order to
ascertain its success. We are, therefore, persuaded, that when
a thread is broken in the manner above described, it is because
it has been spun too weak, and spiders may often be seen breaking
such threads in the process of netting their webs.”</p>

<p>The plan, besides, as explained by these distinguished writers,
would more frequently prove abortive than successful, from the
cut thread not being sufficiently long. They admit, indeed,
that spiders’ lines are often found “a yard or two long, fastened
to twigs of grass not a foot in height.... Here, therefore,
some other process must have been used<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>2. The celebrated English naturalist, Dr. Lister, whose
treatise upon the native spiders of that country, has been the
basis of every subsequent work on the subject, maintains that
“some spiders shoot out their threads in the same manner that
porcupines do their quills<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>; that whereas the quills of the latter
are entirely separated from their bodies, when thus shot out,
the threads of the former remain fixed to their anus, as the
sun’s rays to its body<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.” A French periodical writer goes a little
farther, and says, that spiders have the power of shooting
out threads, <i>and directing them at pleasure towards a determined
point</i>, judging of the distance and position of the object
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
by some sense of which we are ignorant<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. Kirby also
says, that he once observed a small garden spider (<i>Aranea reticulata</i>)
“standing midway on a long perpendicular fixed
thread, and an appearance caught” his “eye, of what seemed
to be the emission of threads.” “I,” therefore, he adds, “moved
my arm in the direction in which they apparently proceeded,
and, as I had suspected, a floating thread attached itself to my
coat, along which the spider crept. As this was connected with
the spinners of the spider, it could not have been formed” by
breaking a “secondary thread<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.” Again, in speaking of the
gossamer-spider, he says, “it first extends its thigh, shank, and
foot, into a right line, and then, elevating its abdomen till it becomes
vertical, <i>shoots its thread</i> into the air, and flies off from
its station<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.”</p>

<p>Another distinguished naturalist, Mr. White of Selborne, in
speaking of the gossamer-spider, says, “Every day in fine
weather in autumn do I see these spiders shooting out their
webs, and mounting aloft: they will go off from the finger, if
you take them into your hand. Last summer, one alighted on
my book as I was reading in the parlor; ran to the top of the
page, and <i>shooting out a web</i>, took its departure from thence.
But what I most wondered at, was, that it went off with considerable
velocity in a place where no air was stirring; and I am
sure I did not assist it with my breath<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“Having so often witnessed,” says Mr. Rennie, “the thread
set afloat in the air by spiders, we can readily conceive the way
in which those eminent naturalists were led to suppose it to be
ejected by some animal force acting like a syringe; but as the
statement can be completely disproved by experiment, we shall
only at present ask, in the words of Swammerdam&mdash;‘how can
it be possible that a thread so fine and slender should be shot
out with force enough to divide and pass through the air?&mdash;is
it not rather probable that the air would stop its progress, and
so entangle it and fit it to perplex the spider’s operations<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>?’”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
The opinion, indeed, is equally improbable with another suggested
by Dr. Lister, that the spider can retract her thread
within the abdomen, after it has been emitted<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. De Geer<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> very
justly joins Swammerdam in rejecting both of these fancies,
which, in our own earlier observations upon spiders, certainly
struck us as plausible and true. There can be no doubt, indeed,
that the animal has a voluntary power of permitting the material
to escape, or stopping it at pleasure, but this is not projectile.</p>

<p>3. “There are many people,” says the Abbé de la Pluche,
“who believe that the spider flies when they see her pass from
branch to branch, and even from one high tree to another; but
she transports herself in this manner; and places herself upon
the end of a branch, or some projecting body, and there fastens
her thread; after which, with her two hind feet, she squeezes
her dugs (<i>spinnerets</i>), and presses out one or more threads of
two or three ells in length, which she leaves to float in the air
till it be fixed to some particular place<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.” Without pretending
to have observed this, Swammerdam says, “I can easily comprehend
how spiders, without giving themselves any motion,
may, by only compressing their spinnerets, force out a thread,
which being driven by the wind, may serve to waft them from
place to place<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.” Others, proceeding upon a similar notion,
give a rather different account of the matter. “The spider,”
says Bingley, “fixes one end of a thread to the place where
she stands, and then with her hind paws <i>draws out</i> several
other threads from the nipples, which, being lengthened out
and driven by the wind to some neighboring tree or other object,
are by their natural clamminess fixed to it<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Observation gives some plausibility to the latter opinion, as
the spider always actively uses her legs, though not to draw
out the thread, but ascertain whether it has caught upon any
object. The notion of her pressing the spinneret with her feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
must be a mere fancy; at least it is not countenanced by anything
which we have observed.</p>

<p>4. An opinion much more recondite is mentioned, if it was
not started, by M. D’Isjonval, that the floating of the spider’s
thread is electrical. “Frogs, cats, and other animals,” he says,
“are affected by natural electricity, and feel the change of weather;
but no other animal more than myself and spiders.” In
wet and windy weather he accordingly found that they spun
very short lines, “<i>but when a spider spins a long thread,
there is a certainty of fine weather for at least ten or twelve
days afterwards</i><a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.” A periodical writer, who signs himself
Carolan<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, fancies that in darting out her thread the spider emits
a stream of air, or some subtle electric fluid, by which she
guides it as if by magic.</p>

</div>

<p>A living writer (Mr. John Murray) whose learning and skill
in conducting experiments give no little weight to his opinions,
has carried these views considerably farther. “The aëronautic
spider,” he says, “can propel its thread both horizontally and
vertically, and at all relative angles, <i>in motionless air</i> and in
an <i>atmosphere agitated by winds</i>; nay more, the aërial traveller
can even dart its thread, to use a nautical phrase, in the
‘wind’s eye.’ My opinion and observations are based on many
hundred experiments.... The entire phenomena are
electrical. When a thread is propelled in a vertical plane, it
remains perpendicular to the horizontal plane always upright,
and when others are projected at angles more or less inclined,
their direction is invariably preserved; the threads never intermingle,
and when a pencil of threads is propelled, it ever presents
the appearance of a divergent brush. These are electrical
phenomena, and cannot be explained but on electrical
principles.”</p>

<p>“In clear, fine weather, the air is invariably positive; and it
is precisely in such weather that the aëronautic spider makes
its ascent most easily and rapidly, whether it be in summer or
winter.” “When the air is weakly positive, the ascent of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
spider will be difficult, and its altitude extremely limited, and
the threads propelled will be but little elevated above the horizontal
plane. When negative electricity prevails, as in cloudy
weather, or on the approach of rain, and the index of De
Saussure’s hygrometer rapidly advancing towards humidity, the
spider is unable to ascend<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Murray tells us, that “when a stick of excited sealing-wax
is brought near the thread of suspension, it is evidently
repelled; consequently, the electricity of the thread is of a
negative character,” while “an excited glass tube brought near,
seemed to attract the thread, and with it the aëronautic
spider<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.” His friend, Mr. Bowman, further describes the aërial
spider as “shooting out four or five, often six or eight, extremely
fine webs several yards long, which waved in the breeze, diverging
from each other like a pencil of rays.” One of them
“had two distinct and widely diverging fasciculi of webs,” and
“a line uniting them would have been at right angles to the
direction of the breeze<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.”</p>

<p>“Such is the chief evidence in support of the electrical theory,”
says Mr. Rennie; “but though we have tried these experiments,
we have not succeeded in verifying any one of them.
The following statements of Mr. Blackwall come nearer our
own observations.</p>

<p>5. ‘Having procured a small branched twig,’ says Mr.
Blackwall, ‘I fixed it upright in an earthen vessel containing
water, its base being immersed in the liquid, and upon it I
placed several of the spiders which produce gossamer. Whenever
the insects thus circumstanced were exposed to a current
of air, either naturally or artificially produced, they directly
turned the thorax towards the quarter whence it came, even
when it was so slight as scarcely to be perceptible, and elevating
the abdomen, they emitted from their spinners a small portion
of glutinous matter, which was instantly carried out in a
line, consisting of four finer ones, with a velocity equal, or nearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
so, to that with which the air moved, as was apparent from
observations made on the motion of detached lines similarly
exposed. The spiders, in the next place, carefully ascertained
whether their lines had become firmly attached to any object
or not, by pulling at them with the front pair of legs; and if
the result was satisfactory, after tightening them sufficiently,
they made them pass to the twig; then discharging from their
spinners, which they applied to the spot where they stood, a
little more of their liquid gum, and committing themselves to
these bridges of their own constructing, they passed over them
in safety, drawing a second line after them, as a security in case
the first gave way, and so effected their escape.</p>

<p>‘Such was invariably the result when spiders were placed
where the air was liable to be sensibly agitated: I resolved, therefore,
to put a bell-glass over them; and in this situation they remained
seventeen days, evidently unable to produce a single
line by which they could quit the branch they occupied, without
encountering the water at its base; though, on the removal
of the glass, they regained their liberty with as much celerity
as in the instances already recorded.</p>

<p>‘This experiment, which, from want of due precaution, has
misled so many distinguished naturalists, I have tried with several
geometric spiders, and always with the same success<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Blackwall, from subsequent experiments, says he is
“confident in affirming, that in motionless air, spiders have not
the power of darting their threads even through the space of
half an inch<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.” The following details are given in confirmation
of this opinion. Mr. Blackwall observed, the 1st of Oct.,
1826, a little before noon, with the sun shining brightly, no
wind stirring, and the thermometer in the shade ranging from
55°.5 to 64°, a profusion of shining lines crossing each other at
every angle, forming a confused net-work, covering the fields
and hedges, and thickly coating his feet and ankles, as he
walked across a pasture. He was more struck with the phenomenon
because on the previous day a strong gale of wind had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
blown from the south, and as gossamer is only seen in calm
weather, it must have been all produced within a very short
time.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>“What more particularly arrested my attention,” says Mr.
Blackwall, “<i>was the ascent of an amazing quantity of webs
of an irregular, complicated structure, resembling ravelled
silk of the finest quality, and clearest white; they were of
various shapes and dimensions, some of the largest measuring
upwards of a yard in length, and several inches in
breadth in the widest part; while others were almost as
broad as long, presenting an area of a few square inches
only</i>.</p>

<p>“These webs, it was quickly perceived, were not formed in
the air, as is generally believed, <i>but at the earth’s surface</i>.
The lines of which they were composed, being brought into
contact by the mechanical action of gentle airs, adhered together,
till, by continual additions, they were accumulated into
flakes or masses of considerable magnitude, on which the ascending
current, occasioned by the rarefaction of the air contiguous
to the heated ground, acted with so much force as to
separate them from the objects to which they were attached,
raising them in the atmosphere to a perpendicular height of at
least several hundred feet. I collected a number of these webs
about mid-day, as they rose; and again in the afternoon, when
the upward current had ceased, and they were falling; but
scarcely one in twenty contained a spider: though, on minute
inspection, I found small winged insects, chiefly <i>aphides</i>, entangled
in most of them.</p>

<p>“From contemplating this unusual display of gossamer, my
thoughts were naturally directed to the animals which produced
it, and the countless myriads in which they swarmed almost
created as much surprise as the singular occupation that
engrossed them. Apparently actuated by the same impulse,
all were intent upon traversing the regions of air; <i>accordingly,
after gaining the summits of various objects, as blades of
grass, stubble, rails, gates, &amp;c., by the slow and laborious
process of climbing, they raised themselves still higher by
strengthening their limbs; and elevating the abdomen, by
bringing it from the usual horizontal position into one almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
perpendicular, they emitted from their spinning apparatus
a small quantity of the glutinous secretion with which
they construct their webs</i>. This viscous substance being
drawn out by the ascending current of rarefied air into fine
lines several feet in length, was carried upward, until the spiders,
feeling themselves acted upon with sufficient force in that
direction, quitted their hold of the objects on which they stood,
and commenced their journey by mounting aloft.</p>

<p>“Whenever the lines became inadequate to the purpose for
which they were intended, by adhering to any fixed body, they
were immediately detached from the spinners and so converted
into terrestrial gossamer, by means of the last pair of legs, and
the proceedings just described were repeated; which plainly
proves that these operations result from a strong desire felt by
the insects to effect an ascent<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.” Mr. Blackwall has recently
read a paper (still unpublished) in the Linnæan Society, confirmatory
of his opinions.</p>

<p>6. “Without going into the particulars,” says Mr. Rennie,
“of what agrees or disagrees in the above experiments with
our own observations, we shall give a brief account of what
we have actually seen in our researches. So far as we have
determined, then, all the various species of spiders, how different
soever the form of their webs may be, proceed in the circumstance
of shooting their lines precisely alike; but those which
we have found the most manageable in experimenting, are the
small gossamer spider (<i>Aranea obtextrix</i>, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>), known
by its shining blackish-brown body and reddish-brown semi-transparent
legs; but particularly the long-bodied spider (<i>Tetragnatha
extensa</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), which varies in color from green
to brownish or grey&mdash;but has always a black line along the
belly, with a silvery white or yellowish one on each side. The
latter is chiefly recommended by being a very industrious and
persevering spinner, while its movements are easily seen, from
the long cylindrical form of its body and the length of its legs.</p>

<p>“We placed the above two species with five or six others, including
the garden, the domestic, and the labyrinthic spiders,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
in empty wine-glasses, set in tea-saucers filled with water, to
prevent their escape. When they discovered, by repeated descents
from the brims of the glasses, that they were thus surrounded
by a wet ditch, they all set themselves to the task of
throwing their silken bridges across. For this purpose they
first endeavored to ascertain in what direction the wind blew,
or rather (as the experiment was made in our study) which
way any current of air set,&mdash;by elevating their arms <i>as we
have seen sailors do in a dead calm</i>. But, as it may prove
more interesting to keep to one individual, we shall first watch
the proceedings of the gossamer spider.</p>

<p>“Finding no current of air on any quarter of the brim of the
glass, it seemed to give up all hopes of constructing its bridge
of escape, and placed itself in the attitude of repose; <i>but no
sooner did we produce a stream of air, by blowing gently
towards its position, than, fixing a thread to the glass, and
laying hold of it with one of its feet, by way of security, it
placed its body in a vertical position, with its spinnerets extended
outwards; and immediately we had the pleasure of
seeing a thread streaming out from them several feet in
length, on which the little aëronaut sprung up into the air</i>.
We were convinced, from what we thus observed, that it was
the double or bend of the thread which was blown into the
air; and we assigned as a reason for her previously attaching
and drawing out a thread from the glass, the wish to give the
wind a <i>point d’appui</i>&mdash;something upon which it might have
a <i>purchase</i>, as a mechanic would say of a lever. The bend
of the thread, then, on this view of the matter, would be carried
out by the wind,&mdash;would form the point of impulsion,&mdash;and,
of course, the escape bridge would be an ordinary line doubled.”</p>

<p>Such is the opinion of Mr. Rennie, which is strongly corroborated
by what has been said by M. Latreille&mdash;than whom no
higher authority could be given. “When the animal,” says
he, “desires to cross a brook, she fixes to a tree or some other
object one of the ends of her first threads, in order that the wind
or a current of air may carry the other beyond the obstacle<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
and as one end is always attached to the spinnerets, he must
mean that the double of the thread flies off. In his previous
publications, however, Latreille had contented himself with
copying the statement of Dr. Lister. “In order to ascertain
the fact,” says Mr. Rennie, “and put an end to all doubts, we
watched, with great care and minuteness, the proceedings of
the long-bodied spider above mentioned, by producing a stream
of air in the same manner, as it perambulated the brim of the
glass. It immediately, as the other had done, attached a thread
and raised its body perpendicularly, like a tumbler standing on
his hands with his head downwards; but we looked in vain for
this thread bending, as we had at first supposed, and going off
double. Instead of this it remained tight, while another thread,
or what appeared to be so, streamed off from the spinners, similar
to smoke issuing through a pin-hole, sometimes in a line,
and sometimes at a considerable angle, with the first, according
to the current of the air,&mdash;the first thread, extended from the
glass to the spinnerets, remaining all the while tight drawn in
a right line. It further appeared to us, that the first thread
proceeded from the pair of spinnerets nearest the head, while
the floating thread came from the outer pair,&mdash;though it is
possible in such minute objects we may have been deceived.
That the first was continuous with the second, without any
perceptible joining, we ascertained in numerous instances, by
catching the floating line and pulling it tight, in which case
the spider glides along without attaching another line to the
glass; but if she have to coil up the floating line to lighten it,
as usually happens, she gathers it into a packet and glues the
two ends tight together. Her body, while the floating line
streamed out, remained quite motionless, but we distinctly
saw the spinnerets not only projected, as is always done when
a spider spins, but moved in the same way as an infant moves
its lips when sucking. We cannot doubt, therefore, that this
motion is intended to emit (if eject or project be deemed words
too strong), the liquid material of the thread; at the same time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
we are quite certain that it cannot throw out a single inch of
thread <i>without the aid of a current of air</i>. A long-bodied
spider will thus throw out in succession as many threads as we
please, by simply blowing towards it; but not one where there
is no current, as under a bell-glass, where it may be kept till it
die, without being able to construct a bridge over water of an
inch long. We never observed more than one floating thread
produced at the same time; though other observers mention
several.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>

</div>

<p>“The probable commencement, we think, of the floating line,
is by the emission of little globules of the glutinous material to
the points of the spinnerules&mdash;perhaps it may be dropped from
them, if not ejected, and the globules being carried off by the
current of air, drawn out into a thread. But we give this as
only a conjecture, for we could not bring a glass of sufficient
power to bear upon the spinnerules at the commencement of
the floating line.</p>

<p>“In subsequent experiments we found, that it was not indispensable
for the spider to rest upon a solid body when producing
a line, as she can do so while she is suspended in the air by
another line. When the current of air also is strong, she will
sometimes commit herself to it by swinging from the end of the
line. We have even remarked this when there was scarcely a
breath of air.</p>

<p>“We tried another experiment. We pressed pretty firmly
upon the base of the spinnerets, so as not to injure the spider,
blowing obliquely over them; but no floating line appeared.
We then touched them with a pencil and drew out several
lines an inch or two in length, upon which we blew in order to
extend them, but in this also we were unsuccessful, as they did
not lengthen more than a quarter of an inch. We next traced
out the reservoirs of a garden-spider (<i>Epeira diadema</i>), and
immediately taking a drop of the matter from one of them on
the point of a fine needle, we directed upon it a strong current
of air, and succeeded in blowing out a thick yellow line, as we
might have done with gum-water, of about an inch and a half
long.</p>

<p>“When we observed our long-bodied spider eager to throw a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
line by raising up its body, we brought within three inches of
its spinnerets an excited stick of sealing-wax, of which it took
no notice, nor did any thread extend to it, not even when
brought almost to touch the spinnerets. We experienced the
same want of success with an excited glass rod; and indeed
had not anticipated any other result, as we have never observed
that either these attract or repel the floating threads, as Mr.
Murray has seen them do; nor have we ever noticed the end
of a floating thread separated into its component threadlets and
diverging like a brush, as he and Mr. Bowman describe (See
Fig. 11.). It may be proper to mention that Mr. Murray, in
conformity with his theory, explains the shooting of lines in a
current of air by the electric state produced by motion in consequence
of the mutual friction of the gaseous particles. But
this view of the matter does not seem to affect our statements.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nests, Webs, and Nets of Spiders.</span>&mdash;“The neatest,”
says Mr. Rennie, “though the smallest spider’s nest which
we have seen, was constructed in the chink of a garden-post,
which we had cut out the previous summer in getting
at the cells of a carpenter-bee. The architect was one of the
larger hunting-spiders, erroneously said by some naturalists to
be incapable of spinning. The nest in question was about
two inches high, composed of a very close satin-like texture.
There were two parallel chambers placed perpendicularly, in
which position also the inhabitant reposed there during the day,
going, as we presume, only abroad to prey during the night.
But the most remarkable circumstance was, that the openings
(two above and two below) were so elastic, that they shut closely
together. We observed this spider for several months, but
at last it disappeared, and we took the nest out under the notion
that it might contain eggs; but found none, and therefore
concluded that it was only used as a day retreat.” The account
which Evelyn has given of these hunting spiders is so
interesting that we must transcribe it.</p>

<p>“Of all sorts of insects,” says he, “none have afforded
me more divertisement than the <i>venatores</i> (hunters), which
are a sort of <i>lupi</i> (wolves) that have their dens in rugged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
walls and crevices of our houses; a small brown and delicately-spotted
kind of spiders, whose hinder legs are longer than the
rest. Such I did frequently observe at Rome, which, espying
a fly at three or four yards distance, upon the balcony where I
stood, would not make directly to her, <i>but crawl under the
rail, till being arrived to the antipodes, it would steal up,
seldom missing its aim; but if it chanced to want anything
of being perfectly opposite, would, at first peep, immediately
slide down again,&mdash;till taking better notice, it would
come the next time exactly upon the fly’s back: but if this
happened not to be within a competent leap, then would this
insect move so softly, as the very shadow of the gnomon
seemed not to be more imperceptible, unless the fly moved;
and then would the spider move also in the same proportion,
keeping that just time with her motion, as if the same soul
had animated both these little bodies; and whether it were
forwards, backwards, or to either side, without at all turning
her body, like a well-managed horse: but if the capricious
fly took wing and pitched upon another place behind
our huntress, then would the spider whirl its body so nimbly
about, as nothing could be imagined more swift: by which
means she always kept the head towards her prey, though,
to appearance, as immoveable as if it had been a nail driven
into the wood, till by that indiscernible progress (being arrived
within the sphere of her reach) she made a fatal leap,
swift as lightning, upon the fly, catching him in the pole,
where she never quitted hold till her belly was full, and then
carried the remainder home</i>.”</p>

<p>One feels a little sceptical, however, when he adds, “I have
beheld them <i>instructing their young ones how to hunt</i>, which
they would sometimes discipline for not well observing; but
when any of the old ones did (as sometimes) miss a leap, <i>they
would run out of the field and hide themselves in their crannies,
as ashamed, and haply not to be seen abroad for four
or five hours after</i>; for so long have I watched the nature of
this strange insect, the contemplation of whose so wonderful
sagacity and address has amazed me; nor do I find in any
chase whatsoever more cunning and stratagem observed. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
have found some of these spiders in my garden, when the
weather, towards spring, was very hot, but they are not so
eager in hunting as in Italy<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.”</p>

<p>We have only to add to this lively narrative, that the hunting-spider,
when he leaps, takes good care to provide against
accidental falls by always swinging himself from a good strong
cable of silk, as Swammerdam correctly states<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>, and which anybody
may recognise, as one of the small hunters (<i>Salticus

<p>Mr. Weston, the editor of “Bloomfield’s Remains,” falls into
a very singular mistake about hunting-spiders, imagining them
to be web-weaving ones which have exhausted their materials,
and are therefore compelled to hunt. In proof of this he gives
an instance which came under his own observation<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>!</p>

<p>“As a contrast,” says Mr. Rennie, “to the little elastic satin
nest of the hunter, we may mention the largest with which we
are acquainted,&mdash;that of the labyrinthic spider (<i>Agelena labyrinthica</i>,
<span class="smcap">Walckenaer</span>). Our readers must often have seen
this nest spread out like a broad sheet in hedges, furze, and
other low bushes, and sometimes on the ground. The middle
of this sheet, which is of a close texture, is swung like a sailor’s
hammock, by <i>silken</i> ropes extended all around to the
higher branches; but the whole curves upwards and backwards,
sloping down to a long funnel-shaped gallery which is
nearly horizontal at the entrance, but soon winds obliquely till
it becomes quite perpendicular. This curved gallery is about a
quarter of an inch in diameter, is much more closely woven
than the sheet part of the web, and sometimes descends into a
hole in the ground, though oftener into a group of crowded
twigs, or a tuft of grass. Here the spider dwells secure, frequently
resting with her legs extended from the entrance of
the gallery, ready to spring out upon whatever insect may fall
into her sheet net. She herself can only be caught by getting
behind her and forcing her out into the web; but though we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
have often endeavored to make her construct a nest under our
eye, we have been as unsuccesful as in similar experiments with
the common house spider (<i>Aranea domestica</i>).</p>

<p>“The house spider’s proceedings were long ago described by
Homberg, and the account has been copied, as usual, by almost
every subsequent writer. Goldsmith has, indeed, given some
strange mis-statements from his own observations, and Bingley
has added the original remark, that, after fixing its first thread,
creeping along the wall, and joining it as it proceeds, it ‘<i>darts
itself to the opposite side</i>, where the other end is to be fastened<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>!’
Homberg’s spider took the more circuitous route of travelling
to the opposite wall, carrying in one of its claws the end
of the thread previously fixed, lest it should stick in the wrong
place. This we believe to be the correct statement, for as the
web is always horizontal, it would seldom answer to commit a
floating thread to the wind, as is done by other species. Homberg’s
spider, after stretching as many lines by way of <i>warp</i> as
it deemed sufficient between the two walls of the corner which
it had chosen, proceeded to cross this in the way our weavers do
in adding the <i>woof</i>, with this difference, that the spider’s threads
were only laid on, and not interlaced<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. The domestic spiders,
however, in these modern days, must have forgot this mode of
weaving, for none of their webs will be found thus regularly
constructed!”</p>

<p>The geometric, or net-working spiders (See Fig. 12. <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate
IV</a>.) are as well known as any of the preceding; almost every
bush and tree in our gardens and hedge-rows having one or
more of their nests stretched out in a vertical position between
adjacent branches. The common garden spider (<i>Epeira diadema</i>),
and the long-bodied spider (<i>Tetragnatha extensa</i>), are
the best known of this order.</p>

<p>“The chief care of a spider of this sort,” says Mr. Rennie,
“is, to form a cable of sufficient strength to bear the net she
means to hang upon it; and after throwing out a floating line
as above described, when it catches properly, she doubles and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
redoubles it with additional threads. On trying its strength she
is not contented with the test of pulling it with her legs, but
drops herself down several feet from various points of it, as we
have often seen, swinging and bobbing with the whole weight
of her body. She proceeds in a similar manner with the rest
of the frame of her wheel-shaped net; and it may be remarked
that some of the ends of these lines are not simple, but in form
of a Y, giving her the additional security of two attachments
instead of one.”</p>

<p>In constructing the body of the nest, the most remarkable
circumstance is the using of her limbs as a measure, to regulate
the distances of her <i>radii</i> or wheel-spokes (See Fig. 12.
<a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV.</a>, which represents the geometric net of the “<i>Epeira
diadema</i>”), and the circular meshes interwoven into them.
These are consequently always proportional to the size of the
spider. She often takes up her station in the centre, but not
always, though it is so said by inaccurate writers; but she as
frequently lurks in a little chamber constructed under a leaf or
other shelter at the corner of her web, ready to dart down upon
whatever prey may be entangled in her net. The centre of
the net is said also to be composed of more viscid materials than
its suspensory lines,&mdash;a circumstance alleged to be proved by
the former appearing under the microscrope studded with globules
of gum<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. “We have not been able,” says Mr. Rennie,
“to verify this distinction, having seen the suspensory lines as
often studded in this manner as those in the centre.”</p>

<p>At the commencement of the last century a method was
discovered in France by Monsieur Bon, of procuring silk from
spiders’ bags, and its use was attempted in the manufacture of
several articles. Mr. Bon has, however, noticed only <i>two</i> kinds
of silk-making spiders, and these he has distinguished from
each other as having either long or short legs, the last variety
producing the finest quality of raw silk. According to this ingenious
observer, the silk formed by these insects is equally
beautiful, strong, and glossy with that formed by the silk-worm.
When first formed, the color of these spiders’ bags is gray, but,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
by exposure to the air, they soon acquire a blackish hue. Other
spider bags might probably be found of different colors, and affording
silk of better quality, but their scarcity would render
any experiment with them difficult of accomplishment; for
which reason M. Bon confined his attention to the bags of the
common sort of the short-legged kind.</p>

<p>These always form their bags in some place sheltered from
the wind and rain, such as the hollow trunks of trees, the corners
of windows or vaults, or under the eaves of houses. A
quantity of the bags was collected from which a new kind of
silk was made, said to be in no respect inferior to the produce
of the silk-worm. It took readily all kinds of dyes, and might
have been wrought into any description of silken fabric. Mr.
Bon had stockings and gloves made from it, some of which he
presented to the Royal Academy of Paris, and others he transmitted
to the Royal Society of London.</p>

<p>This silk was prepared in the following manner:&mdash;Twelve or
thirteen ounces of the bags were beaten with a stick, until they
became entirely freed from dust. They were next washed in
warm water, which was continually changed, until it no longer
became clouded or discolored by the bags under process. After
this they were steeped in a large quantity of water wherein
soap, saltpetre, and gum-arabic had been dissolved. The
whole was then gently boiled during three hours, after which
the bags were rinsed in clear warm water to discharge the
soap. They were finally set out to dry, previous to the operation
of carding, which was then performed with cards differing
from those usually employed with silk, being much finer.
By these means silk of a peculiar ash color was obtained,
which was spun without difficulty. Mr. Bon affirmed that
the thread was both stronger and finer than common silk, and
that therefore fabrics similar to those made with the latter material
might be manufactured from this, there being no reason
for doubting that it would stand any trials of the loom, after
having undergone those of the stocking frame.</p>

<p>The only obstacle, therefore, which appeared to prevent the
establishing of any considerable manufacture from these spider
bags was the difficulty of obtaining them in sufficient abundance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Mr. Bon fancied that this objection could soon be overcome,
and that the art of domesticating and rearing spiders, as
practised with silk-worms, was to be attained. Carried away
by the enthusiasm of one who, having made a discovery, pursues
it with ardor undismayed by difficulties, he met every objection
by comparisons, which perhaps were not wholly and
strictly founded on fact. Contrasted with the spider, and to
favor his arguments, the silk-worm in his hands made a very
despicable figure. He affirmed that the female spider produces
600 or 700 eggs; while of the 100, to which number he limited
the silk-worm, not more than one-half were reared to produce
balls. That the spiders hatched spontaneously, without
any care, in the months of August and September; that the
old spiders dying soon after they have laid their eggs, the young
ones live for ten or twelve months without food, and continue
in their bags without growing, until the hot weather, by putting
their viscid juices in motion, induces them to come forth,
spin, and run about in search of food.</p>

<p>Mr. Bon’s spider establishment, was managed in the following
manner:&mdash;having ordered all the short-legged spiders
which could be collected by persons employed for the purpose,
to be brought to him, he inclosed them in paper coffins and
pots; these were covered with papers, which, as well as the
coffins, were pricked over their surface with pin-holes to admit
air to the prisoners. The insects were duly fed with flies, and
after some time it was found on inspection that the greater
part of them had formed their bags. This advocate for the
rearing of spiders contended that spiders’ bags afforded much
more silk in proportion to their weight than those of the silk-worm;
in proof of which he observed, that thirteen ounces
yield nearly four ounces of pure silk, two ounces of which were
sufficient to make a pair of stockings; whereas stockings made
of common silk were said by him to weigh seven or eight
ounces.</p>

<p>It was objected by some of Mr. Bon’s contemporaries, that
spiders were venomous; and this is so far true that a bite from
some of the species is very painful, producing as much swelling
as the smart sting of a nettle. Mr. Bon, however, asserted that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
he was several times bitten, without experiencing any inconvenience;
if so, he was more fortunate or less sensitive than any
of the spider-tamers with whom we have been acquainted. It
was further asserted, that this venom extended itself to the silk
which the spider produced; but this assertion was utterly absurd,
as any one who has ever applied a cobweb to stop the
bleeding from a cut ought to have known. Mr. Bon declared
with perfect truth, that the silk, so far from being pernicious,
was useful in staunching and healing wounds, its natural gluten
acting as a kind of balsam.</p>

<p>The honest enthusiasm of the projector, and the singularity
of a regular establishment being formed for rearing and working
spiders, excited a considerable share of public attention. It
was, indeed, an age of strange speculations, for nearly at the
same time a German gentleman broached a scheme for turning
tame squirrels and mice to account in spinning; and companies
were formed in England, with large nominal capitals to
carry out schemes still more preposterous. So important did
Mr. Bon’s project appear to the French Academy, that they
deputed the eminent naturalist, M. Réaumur, to investigate
the merits of this new silk-filament.</p>

<p>After a long and patient examination M. Réaumur stated the
following objections to Mr. Bon’s plan for raising spider-silk,
which have ever since been regarded as insurmountable.</p>

<p>1. The natural fierceness of spiders renders them unfit to be
bred together. On distributing four or five thousand of these
insects into cells or companies of from fifty to one or two hundred,
it was found that the larger spiders quickly <i>killed and
ate the smaller</i>, so that in a short space of time the cells were
depopulated, scarcely more than one or two being found in each
cell.</p>

<p>2. The silk of the spider is inferior to that of the silk-worm
both in lustre and strength; and produces less material in proportion,
than can be made available for the purposes of the
manufacture. The filament of the spider’s-bag can support a
weight of only thirty-six grains, while that of the silk-worm
will sustain a weight of one hundred and fifty grains. Thus
four or five threads of the spider must be brought together to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
equal one thread of the silk-worm, and as it is impossible that
these should be applied so accurately over each other as not to
leave little vacant spaces between them, the light is not equally
reflected, and the lustre of the material is consequently inferior
to that in which a solid thread is used.</p>

<p>3. A great disadvantage of the spider’s silk is, that it cannot
be wound off the ball like that of the silk-worm, but must necessarily
be carded. By this latter process, its evenness, which
contributes so materially to its lustre, is destroyed.</p>

<p>The ferociousness and pugnacity of the spiders are not exaggerated;
they fight like furies. Their voracity, too, is almost
incredible, and it is very questionable whether the mere
collection of flies sufficient to feed a large number of the spiders
would not involve an amount of expense fatal to the project
as a lucrative undertaking. The strength of the spiders’
filament is, if anything, overstated by Réaumur. Deficiency
of lustre arising from the carding of the filaments is common
to the spider-fabric and to spun silk; this objection would, perhaps,
not be of very great weight but for the decisive calculation
by which Réaumur showed the comparative amount of
production between the spider and the silk-worm.</p>

<p>The largest cocoons weigh four, and the smaller three grains
each; spider-bags do not weigh above one grain each; and,
after being cleared of their dust, have lost two-thirds of this
weight; therefore the <i>work of twelve spiders</i> equals that of
<i>only one silk-worm</i>; and a pound of spider-silk would require
for its production 27,648 insects. But as the bags are wholly
the work of the females, who spin them as a deposit for their
eggs, it follows that 55,296 spiders must be reared to yield one
pound of silk: yet this will be obtained only from the best
spiders; those large ones ordinarily seen in gardens, &amp;c., yielding
not more than a twelfth part of the silk of the others.
The work of 280 of these would therefore not yield more silk
than the produce of one industrious silk-worm, and 663,552 of
them would furnish only one pound of silk!</p>

<p>Although Réaumur’s report completely extinguished Mr.
Bon’s project in France, it was revived in England two or
three times in the early part of the last century. Swift has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
not neglected to make it a portion of his unrivalled satire
against speculators and projectors, in his account of Gulliver’s
visit to the Academy of Lagado:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I went into another room, says he, where the walls and ceilings were all hung
round with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out. At
my entrance he called out to me not to disturb his webs. He lamented the fatal
mistake the world had been so long in, of using silk-worms, while we had such
plenty of domestic insects, who infinitely excelled the former, because they understood
how to weave as well as spin. And he proposed further, that, by employing
spiders, the charge of dyeing silk should be wholly saved; whereof I was fully
convinced, when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully colored,
wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us that the webs would take a tincture from
them, and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to suit every body’s fancy, as soon
as he could find proper food for the flies, of certain gums, oils, and other glutinous
matter to give a strength and consistency to the threads.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ingenuity of Spiders.</span>&mdash;Mr. Thomas Ewbank of
New York, in a letter to the Editor of the Journal of the
Franklin Institute, bearing date September 20th, 1842, gives us
the following interesting description of the ingenuity of the
Spider.</p>

<p>“The resources of the lower animals have often excited admiration,
and though no comprehensive and systematic series of
observations have yet been made upon them(?), the time is, I
believe, not distant when the task will be undertaken&mdash;perhaps
within the next century. But whenever and by whomsoever
accomplished, the mechanism of animals will then form the
subject of one of the most interesting and <i>useful</i> volumes in
the archives of man.</p>

<p>“Among insects, spiders have repeatedly been observed to
modify and change their contrivances for <i>ensnaring their
prey</i>. Those that live in fields and gardens often fabricate
their nets or webs vertically. This sometimes occurs in locations
where there is no object sufficiently near to which the
lower edge or extremity of the web can properly be braced;
and unless this be done, light puffs or breezes of wind are apt
to blow it into an entangled mass. Instead of being spread out,
like the sail of a ship, to the wind, it would become clewed over
the upper line, or edge, like a sail when furled up. Now how
would a human engineer act under similar circumstances? But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
ere the reader begins to reflect(!), he should bear in mind that
it would not do to brace the web by running rigging from it to
some <i>fixed</i> or immovable object below&mdash;by no means;&mdash;for were
this done, it could not yield to impulses of wind; the rigging
would be snapped by the first blast, and the whole structure
probably destroyed.</p>

<p>“Whatever contrivances human sagacity might suggest, they
could hardly excel those which these despised engineers sometimes
adopt. Having formed a web, under circumstances similar
to those to which we have referred, a spider has been known
to descend from it to the ground by means of a thread spun for
the purpose, and after selecting a minute pebble, or piece of
stone, has coiled the end of the thread round it. Having done
this, the ingenious artist ascended, and fixing himself on the
lower part of the web, hoisted up the pebble until it swung several
inches clear of the ground. The cord to which the weight
was suspended was then secured by additional ones, running
from it to different parts of the web, which thus acquired the
requisite tension, and was allowed, at the same time, to yield to
sudden puffs of wind without danger of being rent asunder.</p>

<p>“A similar instance came under my notice a few days ago.
A large spider had constructed his web, in nearly a vertical position,
about six feet from the ground, in a corner of my yard.
The upper edge was formed by a strong thread, secured at one
end to a vine leaf, and the other to a clothes line. One part of
the lower edge was attached to a Penyan sun-flower, and another
to a trellis fence, four or five feet distant. Between these
there was no object nearer than the ground, to which an additional
brace line could be carried; but two threads, a foot asunder,
descended from this part of the web, and, eight or ten inches
below it, were united at a point. From this point, a single line,
four or five inches long, was suspended, and to its lower extremity
was the weight, a <i>living one</i>, viz. a worm, <i>three inches
long</i>, and <i>one-eighth of an inch thick</i>. The cord was fastened
around the middle of the victim’s body, and as no object was
within reach, all its writhings and efforts to escape were fruitless.
Its weight answered the same purpose as a piece of inanimate
matter, while its sufferings seemed not in the least to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
disturb the unconcerned murderer, who lay waiting for his prey
above.</p>

<p>“Whether the owner of the web found it a more easy task
to capture this unlucky worm and raise it, than to elevate a
stone of the same weight, may be a question(?). Perhaps in
seeking for the latter, the former fell in his way, and was seized
as the first suitable object that came to hand&mdash;like the human
tyrant, (Domitian) who, to show his skill in archery, planted
his arrows in the heads of men or cattle, in the absence of other
targets. It may be, however, that a piece of stone, earth, or
wood, of a suitable weight, was not in the vicinity of the web.</p>

<p>“To observe the effect of this weight, I separated, with a
pair of scissors, the thread by which it was suspended, and instantly
the web sunk to half its previous dimensions&mdash;the lower
part became loose, and with the slightest current kept shaking
like a sail shivering in the wind. A fresh weight was not supplied
by the next morning; but instead of it two long brace
lines extended from the lower part of the web to two vine tendrils,
a considerable distance off. These I cut away to see what
device would be next adopted, but on going to examine it the
following day, I found the clothes line removed, and with it all
relics of the insect’s labors had disappeared.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mason-Spiders.</span>&mdash;A no less wonderful structure is composed
by a sort of spiders, natives of the tropics and the south
of Europe, which have been justly called mason-spiders by M.
Latreille. One of these (<i>Mygale nidulans</i>, <span class="smcap">Walckn</span>.), found
in the West Indies, “digs a hole in the earth obliquely downwards,
about three inches in length, and one in diameter.
This cavity she lines with a tough thick web, which, when
taken out, resembles a leathern purse; but what is most curious,
this house has a door with hinges, like the operculum of
some sea-shells, and herself and family, who tenant this nest,
open and shut the door whenever they pass and repass. This
history was told me,” says Darwin, “and the nest, with its door,
shown me by the late Dr. Butt, of Bath, who was some years
physician in Jamaica<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
“The nest of a mason-spider, similar to this,” says Mr. Rennie,
“has been obligingly put into our hands by Mr. Riddle of
Blackheath. It came from the West Indies, and is probably
that of Latreille’s clay-kneader (<i>Mygale cratiens</i>), and one of
the smallest of the genus. We have since seen a pair of these
spiders in possession of Mr. William Mello, of Blackheath.
The nest is composed of very hard argillaceous clay, deeply
tinged with brown oxide of iron. It is in form of a tube, about
one inch in diameter, between six and seven inches long, and
slightly bent towards the lower extremity&mdash;appearing to have
been mined into the clay rather than built. The interior of
the tube is lined <i>with a uniform tapestry of silken web, of
an orange-white color</i>, with a texture intermediate between
India paper and very fine glove leather. But the most wonderful
part of this nest is its entrance, which we look upon as
the perfection of insect architecture. A circular door, about
the size of a crown piece, slightly concave on the outside and
convex within, is formed of more than a dozen layers of the
same web which lines the interior, closely laid upon one another,
and shaped so that the inner layers are the broadest, the
outer being gradually less in diameter, except towards the
hinge, which is about an inch long; and in consequence of all
the layers being united there, and prolonged into the tube, it
becomes the thickest and strongest part of the structure. The
elasticity of the materials, also, gives to this hinge the remarkable
peculiarity of acting like a spring, and shutting the door
of the nest spontaneously. It is, besides, made to fit so accurately
to the aperture, which is composed of similar concentric
layers of web, that it is almost impossible to distinguish the
joining by the most careful inspection. To gratify curiosity,
the door has been opened and shut hundreds of times, without
in the least destroying the power of the spring. When the
door is shut, it resembles some of the lichens (<i>Lecidea</i>), or the
leathery fungi, such as <i>Polyporus versicolor</i> (<span class="smcap">Micheli</span>), or,
nearer still, the upper valve of a young oyster-shell. The door
of the nest, the only part seen above ground, being of a blackish-brown
color, it must be very difficult to discover.”</p>

<p>Another mason-spider (<i>Mygale cœmentaria</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
in the south of France, usually selects for her nest a place bare
of grass, sloping in such a manner as to carry off the water,
and of a firm soil, without rocks or small stones. She digs a
gallery a foot or two in depth, and of a diameter (equal
throughout) sufficient to admit of her easily passing. She
lines this <i>with a tapestry of silk glued to the walls</i>. The
door, which is circular, is constructed of many layers of earth
kneaded, and bound together with <i>silk</i>. Externally, it is flat
and rough, corresponding to the earth around the entrance, for
the purpose, no doubt, of concealment: on the inside it is convex,
<i>and tapestried thickly with a web of fine silk</i>. The
threads of this door-tapestry are prolonged, and strongly attached
to the upper side of the entrance, forming an excellent
hinge, which, when pushed open by the spider, shuts again by
its own weight, without the aid of spring hinges. When the
spider is at home, and her door forcibly opened by an intruder,
she pulls it strongly inwards, and even where half-opened often
snatches it out of the hand; but when she is foiled in this, she
retreats to the bottom of her den, as her last resource<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. The
nest of this spider (the mason spider) is represented in <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate
IV.</a> Fig. 14., and shows the nest shut. Fig. 15., represents it
open. Fig. 16. the spider (<i>Mygale cœmentaria</i>). Fig. 17.
the eyes magnified. Figures 18 and 19 parts of the foot and
claw magnified. Rossi ascertained that the female of an allied
species (<i>Mygale sauvagesii</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), found in Corsica, lived in
one of these nests, with a numerous posterity. He destroyed
one of the doors to observe whether a new one would be made,
which it was; but it was fixed immoveably, without a hinge;
the spider, no doubt, fortifying herself in this manner till she
thought she might re-open it without danger<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.</p>

<p>“The Rev. Revett Shepherd has often noticed, in the fen
ditches of Norfolk, a very large spider (the species not yet determined)
which actually forms a <i>raft</i> for the purpose of obtaining
its prey with more facility. Keeping its station upon a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
ball of weeds about three inches in diameter, probably held together
by slight silken cords, it is wafted along the surface of
the water upon this floating island, which it quits the moment
it sees a drowning insect. The booty thus seized it devours at
leisure upon its raft, under which it retires when alarmed by
any danger<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.” In the spring of 1830, Mr. Rennie found a spider
on some reeds in the Croydon Canal, which agreed in appearance
with Mr. Shepherd’s.</p>

<p>Among our native spiders there are several, which, not contented
with a web like the rest of their congeners, take advantage
of other materials to construct cells where, “<i>hushed in
grim repose</i>,” they “expect their insect prey.” The most
simple of those spider cells is constructed by a longish-bodied
spider (<i>Aranea holosericea</i>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span>), which is a little larger
than the common hunting spider. It rolls up a leaf of the lilac
or poplar, precisely in the same manner as is done by the leaf-rolling
caterpillars, upon whose cells it sometimes seizes to save
itself trouble, having first expelled, or perhaps devoured, the
rightful owner. The spider, however, is not satisfied with the
tapestry of the caterpillar, <i>but always weaves a fresh set of
her own</i>, more close and substantial.</p>

<p>Another spider, common in woods and copses (<i>Epeira quadrata?</i>)
weaves together a great number of leaves to form a
dwelling for herself, and in front of it she spreads her toils for
entrapping the unwary insects which stray thither. These, as
soon as caught, are dragged into her den, and stored up for a
time of scarcity. Here also her eggs are deposited and hatched
in safety. When the cold weather approaches, and the leaves
of her edifice wither, she abandons it for the more secure shelter
of a hollow tree, where she soon dies; but the continuation
of the species depends upon eggs, deposited in the nest before
winter, and remaining to be hatched with the warmth of the
ensuing summer.</p>

<p>The spider’s den of united leaves, however, which has just
been described, is not always useless when withered and deserted;
for the dormouse usually selects it as a ready-made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
roof for its nest of dried grass. That those old spiders’ dens
are not accidentally chosen by the mouse, appears from the
fact, that out of about a dozen mouse-nests of this sort found
during winter in a copse between Lewisham and Bromley,
Kent (England), every second or third one was furnished with
such a roof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Water Spider.</span>&mdash;We extract the following exquisitely
beautiful and interesting fact in nature, <i>connected with
diving operations</i>, from the Rev. Mr. Kirby’s Bridgewater
Treatise:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Water Spider is one of the most remarkable upon
whom that office (diving) is developed by her Creator. To
this end, her instinct instructs her to fabricate a kind of <i>diving-bell</i>
in the bosom of that element. She usually selects still
waters for this purpose. Her house is an <i>oval cocoon</i>, filled
with air, and lined with <i>silk</i>, from which threads issue in every
direction, and are fastened to the surrounding plants; in this
cocoon, which is open below, she watches for her prey, and even
appears to pass the winter, when she closes the opening. It is
most commonly, yet not always, entirely under water; but its
inhabitant has filled it with air for her respiration, which enables
her to live in it. She conveys the air to it in the following
manner: she usually swims upon her back, when her abdomen
is enveloped in a bubble of air, and appears like a globe of
quicksilver<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>; with this she enters her cocoon, and displacing an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
equal mass of water, again ascends for a second lading, till
she has sufficiently filled her house with it, so as to expel all
the water.</p>

<p>“The males construct similar habitations by the same manœuvres.
How these little animals can envelope their abdomen
with an air-bubble, and retain it till they enter their cells,
is still one of Nature’s mysteries that have not been explained.</p>

<p>“We, however, cannot help admiring, and adoring, the wisdom,
power, and goodness manifested in this singular provision,
enabling an animal that breathes the atmospheric air, to fill
her house with it under water, and which has instructed her in
a secret art, <i>by which she can clothe part of her body with air
as a garment</i>, and which she can put off when it answers her
purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is a kind of attraction and repulsion which mocks all our inquiries.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_179" href="#FNanchor_179" class="label">[179]</a> Her singular economy was first, we believe, described by Clerck (Aranei
Suecici, Stockholm, 1757.), L. M. de Lignac (Mém. des Araign. Aquat., 12mo.
Paris, 1799.), and De Geer.</p>

<p>“The shining appearance,” says Clerck, “proceeds either from an inflated
globule surrounding the abdomen, or from the space between the body and the
water. The spider, when wishing to inhale the air, rises to the surface, with its
body still submersed, and only the part containing the spinneret rising just to the
surface, when it briskly opens and moves its four teats. A thick coat of hair
keeps the water from approaching or wetting the abdomen. It comes up for air
about four times an hour or oftener, though I have good reason to suppose it can
continue without it for several days together.</p>

<p>“I found in the middle of May one male and ten females, which I put into a
glass filled with water, where they lived together very quietly for eight days. I
put some duck-weed (<i>Lemna</i>) into the glass to afford them shelter, and the females
began to stretch diagonal threads in a confused manner from it to the sides
of the glass about half way down. Each of the females afterwards fixed a close
bag to the edge of the glass, from which the water was expelled by the air from
the spinneret, and thus a cell was formed capable of containing the whole animal.
Here they remained quietly, with their abdomens in their cells, and their bodies
still plunged in the water; and in a short time brimstone-colored bags of eggs appeared
in each cell, filling it about a fourth part. On the 7th of July several
young ones swam out from one of the bags. All this time the old ones had nothing
to eat, <i>and yet they never attacked one another</i>, as other spiders would have
been apt to do (Clerck, Aranei Suecici, cap. viii.).”</p>

<p>“These spiders,” says De Geer, “spin in the water a cell of strong, <i>closely woven,
white silk</i> in the form of half the shell of a pigeon’s egg, or like a diving bell.
This is sometimes left partly above water, but at others is entirely submersed, and
is always attached to the objects near it by a great number of irregular threads.
It is closed all round, but has a large opening below, which, however, I found
closed on the 15th of December, and the spider living quietly within, with her
head downwards. I made a rent in this cell, and expelled the air, upon which
the spider came out; yet though she appeared to have been laid up for three
months in her winter quarters, she greedily seized upon an insect and sucked it.
I also found that the male as well as the female constructs a similar subaqueous
cell, and during summer no less than in winter (De Geer, Mém. des Insectes, vii.
312.).” “We have recently kept one of these spiders,” says Mr. Rennie, “for
several months in a glass of water, where it built a cell half under water, in which
it laid its eggs.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Thus it appears, that by the successive descents of the little
water-spider under the impulsion of its instinct, produce effects

in its subaqueous pavilion equivalent to those produced in the
diving-bell, or diving helmet, by the successive strokes of the
condensing air-pump of scientific man!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
In the language of the book of Psalms, this insect “LAYETH
THE BEAMS OF” her “CHAMBERS IN THE
WATERS,” and there secures her subaqueous chambers in the
manner described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleanliness of Spiders.</span>&mdash;“When we look at the viscid
material,” says Mr. Rennie, “with which spiders construct their
lines and webs, and at the rough, hairy covering (with a few
exceptions) of their bodies, we might conclude, that they would
be always stuck over with fragments of the minute fibres
which they produce. This, indeed, must often happen, did
they not take careful precautions to avoid it; for we have observed
that they seldom, if ever, leave a thread to float at random,
except when they wish to form a bridge. When a spider
drops along a line, for instance, in order to ascertain the strength
of her web, or the nature of the place below her, she invariably,
when she re-ascends, coils it up into a little ball, and
throws it away. Her claws are admirably adapted for this purpose,
as well as for walking along the lines, as may be readily
seen by a magnifying glass. Fig. 13. <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV.</a> shows the triple-clawed
foot of a spider, magnified, the others being toothed
like a comb, for gliding along the lines. This structure, however,
unfits it to walk, as flies can do, upon any upright polished
surface like glass; although the contrary<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> is erroneously asserted
by the Abbé de la Pluche. Before she can do so, she is
obliged to construct a ladder of ropes, as Mr. Blackwall remarks<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>,
by elevating her spinneret as high as she can, and laying
down a step upon which she stands to form a second; and
so on, as any one may try by placing a spider at the bottom of
a very clean wine glass.</p>

<p>“The hairs of the legs, however, are always catching bits of
web and particles of dust; but these are not suffered to remain
long. Most people may have remarked that the house-fly is
ever and anon brushing its feet upon one another to rub off the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
dust, though we have not seen it remarked in authors that spiders
are equally assiduous in keeping themselves clean. They
have, besides, a very efficient instrument in their mandibles or
jaws, which, like their claws, are furnished with teeth; and a
spider which appears to a careless observer as resting idly, in
nine cases out of ten will be found <i>slowly combing her legs
with her mandibles, beginning as high as possible on the
thigh, and passing down to the claws</i>. The flue which she
thus combs off is regularly tossed away.</p>

<p>“With respect to the house-spider (<i>A. domestica</i>), we are
told in books, that ‘she from time to time clears away the dust
from her web, and sweeps the whole by giving it a shake with
her paw, so nicely proportioning the force of her blow, that she
never breaks any thing<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.’ That spiders may be seen shaking
their webs in this manner, we readily admit; though it is not,
we imagine, to clear them of dust, but to ascertain whether
they are sufficiently sound and strong.</p>

<p>“We recently witnessed a more laborious process of cleaning
a web than merely shaking it. On coming down the Maine
by the steam-boat from Frankfort, in August 1829, we observed
the geometric-net of a conic spider (<i>Epeira conica</i>, <span class="smcap">Walck.</span>)
on the framework of the deck, and as it was covered with
flakes of soot from the smoke of the engine, we were surprised
to see a spider at work on it; for, in order to be useful, this sort
of net must be clean. Upon observing it a little closely, however,
we perceived that she was not constructing a net, but
dressing up an old one; though not, we must think, to save
trouble, so much as an expenditure of material. Some of the
lines she dexterously stripped of the flakes of soot adhering to
them; but in the greater number, finding that she could not
get them sufficiently clean, she broke them quite off, bundled
them up, and tossed them over. We counted five of these
packets of rubbish which she thus threw away, though there
must have been many more, as it was some time before we discovered
the manœuvre, the packets being so small as not to be
readily perceived, except when placed between the eye and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
light. When she had cleared off all the sooted lines, she began
to replace them in the usual way; but the arrival of the boat
at Mentz put an end to our observations.” Bloomfield, the
poet, having observed the disappearance of these bits of ravelled
web, says that he observed a garden spider moisten the pellets
before swallowing them! Dr. Lister, as we have already seen,
thought the spider retracted the threads within the abdomen.</p>

<p>“I could wish,” says Addison, in ‘The Spectator,’ “our Royal Society would
compile a body of natural history, the best that could be gathered together from
books and observations. If the several writers among them took each his particular
species, and gave us a distinct account of its original, birth, and education;
its policies, hostilities, and alliances; with the frame and texture of its inward and
outward parts,&mdash;and particularly those which distinguish it from all other animals,&mdash;with
their aptitudes for the state of being in which Providence has placed them;
it would be one of the best services their studies could do mankind, and not a little
redound to the glory of the All-wise Creator.”&mdash;‘Spectator,’ No. iii.</p>

<p>Although we do not consider Addison as a naturalist, in any of the usual meanings
of the term, yet it would be no easy task, even for those who have devoted their
undivided attention to the subject, to improve upon the admirable plan of study here
laid down. It is, moreover, so especially applicable to the investigation of insects,
that it may be more or less put in practice by any person who chooses, in whatever
station or circumstances he happens to be placed. Nay, we will go farther; for
since it agrees with experience and many recorded instances that individuals have
been enabled to investigate and elucidate particular facts, who were quite unacquainted
with systematic natural history, we hold it to be undeniable, that <i>any person of
moderate penetration, though altogether unacquainted with what is called “Natural
History</i>,” who will take the trouble to observe particular facts and endeavor to
trace them to their causes, has every chance to be successful in adding to his own
knowledge, and frequently in making discoveries of what was previously unknown.
It is related of M. Pélissan, while a prisoner in the Bastille, that he tamed a spider
by means of music. This in conjunction with Evelyn’s observations on hunting-spiders
is strong proof of our position, and show that though books are often
of high value to guide us in our observations, they are by no means indispensable
to the study of nature, inasmuch as the varied scene of creation itself forms an
inexhaustible book, which “even he who runneth may read.”</p>

<p>“It will be of the utmost importance, in the study here recommended, to bear
in mind that an insect can never be found in any situation, nor make any movement,
without some motive, originating in the instinct imparted to it by Providence.
This principle alone, when it is made the basis of inquiry into such motives
or instincts, will be found productive of many interesting discoveries, which,
without it, might never be made. With this, indeed, exclusively in view, during
an excursion, and with a little attention and perseverance, every walk&mdash;nay,
every step&mdash;may lead to delightful and interesting knowledge.”&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Insect Architecture</span>,”

<p>In the preceding chapter we have confined our remarks,
principally, to the various attempts made to obtain a silken or
filamentous material from the spider, and although those efforts
have not been crowned with that degree of success which would
render a speculation of the kind worthy of our attention in a
pecuniary point of view, yet, it must be conceded, that the subject
is scarcely the less interesting; and Mr. Bon, the gentleman
who first undertook the training of spiders, has at least
given us matter for further interesting speculation. It is now
about 104 years since Mr. Bon commenced his experiments.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we shall proceed to describe the Pinna of the
ancients, and upon which human ingenuity has been more
successfully exercised in seeking, many feet below the surface
of the Ocean, for the slender filaments, the produce of an animal
in almost a vegetative state of existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
The Pinna is a bivalve<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> shell-fish, which, when full grown,
is 18 inches long, and 6 wide at its broad end. It is found
near the shores of South Italy, Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia;
also in the Bay of Smyrna, and in the Indian Ocean. It does
not fasten itself to rocks in the same position as the muscle, but
sticks its sharp end into the mud or sand, while the rest of the
shell is at liberty to open in the water. In common with the
muscle, it has the power of spinning a viscid matter from its
body, conformably with that of the spider and caterpillar. Although
the pinna is vastly larger than the muscle, its shell being
sometimes found two feet long, the threads which it produces
are more delicate and slender than those of the muscle, being
in fineness and beauty scarcely inferior to the single filament
of the comparatively minute silk-worm. Threads so delicately
thin, as may readily be imagined, do not singly possess much
strength; but the little power of each is made up by the aggregate
of the almost infinite number which each fish puts forth
to secure itself in a fixed situation, and preserve it against the
rolling of the waves. The threads are, however, similar in
their nature to those of the muscle, differing only in their superior
fineness and greater length. These fish have, therefore,
been distinguished by some naturalists, the one as the silk-worm,
the other as caterpillar of the sea.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_183" href="#FNanchor_183" class="label">[183]</a> An animal having two valves, or a shell consisting of two parts which open
and shut.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>It has been from a very remote period well known, that muscles
have the power of affixing themselves either to rocks or the
shells of one another, in a very firm manner; yet their method
of effecting this was not understood until explained by the accurate
observations of M. Réaumur, the <i>first</i> naturalist who ascertained
that if, by any accident, the animals were torn from
their hold, they possessed the power of substituting other threads
for those which had been broken or injured. It was found by
him, that if muscles, detached from each other, were placed in
any kind of vessel and then plunged into the sea, they contrived
in a very short time to fasten themselves both to the
vessel’s side and one another’s shells: in this process, the extremity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
of each thread seemed to perform the office of a hand
in seizing upon the body to which it would attach itself.</p>

<p>The threads issue from the shell at that part where it naturally
opens, and in affixing themselves to any substance, form
numerous minute cables, by which the fish steadies itself in the
water. Each animal is provided with an organ, which it is
difficult to designate by any name, since it performs the office
of so many members, and is the only indicator of the existence
of vital powers in the creature. It is by turns a tongue, an
arm, and sometimes a leg. Its shape resembles that of a
tongue, and is, therefore, most frequently called by that name.
Whenever the fish requires to change its place, this member
serves to drag its body forward, together with its cumbrous habitation:
in performing a journey, the extremity of this organ,
which may then be styled a leg, is fixed to some solid body,
and being then contracted in length, the whole fish is necessarily
drawn towards the spot where it intends to station itself;
and by a repetition of these movements, the animal arrives at
its destination. It is not often that the organ is put to this use,
as the pinna is but little addicted to locomotion: some naturalists
indeed affirm that it is always stable. The purpose to
which the tongue is most frequently applied, is that of spinning
the threads. Although this body is flat, and in form similar to
a tongue through the greater part of its length, it becomes cylindrical
about the base or root, where it is much smaller than
in any other part: at this lower end are several ligatures of a
muscular nature, which keep the tongue firmly fixed against
the middle of the shell; four of these cords are very apparent,
and serve to move the tongue in any direction according to the
wants of the fish. Through the entire length of this member
there runs a slit, which pierces so deeply into its surface, as almost
to divide it into two longitudinal sections; this performs the
office of a canal for the liquor of which the threads are formed,
and serves to mould them into their proper form: the canal appears
externally like a small crack, being almost covered by the
flesh from either side, but internally it is much wider, and surrounded
by circular fibres. The channel thus formed extends
regularly from the tip to the base of the tongue, where it partakes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
of the form of the member and becomes cylindric, producing
there a tube or pipe in which the canal terminates. The
viscid substance is moulded in this tube into the shape of a cord,
similar to the threads produced from it, though much thicker,
and from which all the minute fibres issue and disperse. The
internal surface of the tube, wherein the large cord is formed, is
furnished with glands for the secretion of the peculiar substance
employed in its production, and which is always in great abundance
in this animal as well as in muscles.</p>

<p>Réaumur observed, “that although the workmanship of the
land and sea animals when completed is alike, the manner of
its production is very different. Spiders, caterpillars, &amp;c., form
threads of any required length, by making the viscous liquor
of which the filament is formed pass through fine perforations
in the organ appointed for spinning. But the way in which
muscles form their thread is widely opposite; as the former resembles
the work of the wire-drawer<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>, so does the latter that of
the founder who casts metals in a mould.” The canal of the
organ destined for the muscle’s spinning is the mould in which
its thread is cast, and gives to it its determinate length.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> This remark of M. Réaumur confirms the observations of M. H. Straus, quoted
in Chapter VII. that the thread of the silk-worm is not produced by a simple emission
of liquid matter through the orifices of the spinner, or that it acquires solidity
at once from the drying influence of the air. Indeed, silk cannot be produced in
this manner, but is <i>secreted in the form of silk in silk vessels</i>, and the spinning
apparatus, so called, only unwinds it. Mr. Straus’s observations on this head admit
of no argument. The discovery reduces all that has been heretofore written
upon the subject to the character of old lumber.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Réaumur learned the manner of the muscle performing the
operation of swimming by actually placing some of these fish
under his constant inspection. He kept them in his apartment
in a vessel filled with sea water, and distinctly saw them open
their shells and put forth their tongues. They extended and
contracted this organ several times, obtruding it in every direction,
as if seeking the fittest place whereon to fix their threads.
After repeated trials of this kind, the tongue of one was observed
to remain for some time on the spot chosen, and being
then drawn back with great quickness, a thread was very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
easily discerned, fastened to the place: this operation was again
resumed, until all the threads were in sufficient number: one
fibre being produced at each movement of the tongue.</p>

<p>The old threads were found to differ materially from those
newly spun, the latter being whiter, more glossy, and transparent
than the former, and it was thence discovered that it was
not the office of the tongue to transfer the old threads one by
one to the new spots where they were fixed, which course M.
Réaumur had thought was pursued. The old threads once
severed from the spot to which they had been originally fixed
were seen to be useless, and that every fibre employed by the
fish to secure itself in a new position was produced at the time
required; and, in short, that nature had endowed some fish, as
well as land insects, with the power of spinning threads, as
their natural wants and instincts demanded. This fact was incontrovertibly
established by cutting away, as close to the body
as they could with safety be separated, the old threads, which
were always replaced by others in a space of time as short as
was employed by other muscles not so deprived.</p>

<p>“The pinna and its cancer friend” have on more than one
occasion been made subjects for poetry. There is doubtless
some foundation for the fact of the mutual alliance between
these aquatic friends which has been thus celebrated; yet some
slight coloring may have been borrowed from the regions of
fancy wherewith to adorn the verse, and even the prose history
of their attachment may be exposed to a similar objection.</p>

<p>The scuttle-fish, a native of the same seas with the pinna, is
its deadly foe, and would quickly destroy it, were it not for its
faithful ally. In common with all the same species, the pinna is
destitute of the organs of sight, and could not, therefore, unassisted,
be aware of the vicinity of its dangerous enemy. A
small animal of the crab kind, itself deprived of a covering, but
extremely quick-sighted, takes refuge in the shell of the pinna,
whose strong calcareous valves affords a shelter to her guest,
<i>while he makes a return for this protection by going forth in
search of prey</i>. At these intervals the pinna opens her valves
to afford him egress and ingress: if the watchful scuttle-fish
now approach, the crab returns instanter with notice of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
danger to her hostess; who, timely warned, shuts her door and
keeps out the enemy. When the crab has, unmolested, succeeded
in loading itself with provisions, <i>it gives a signal by a
gentle noise at the opening of the shell</i>, and when admitted,
the two friends feast together on the fruit of its industry. It
would appear an arduous, nay, a task almost impossible for the
defenceless and diminutive crab, not merely to elude its enemies
and return home, but likewise obtain a supply of provender
sufficient to satisfy the wants of its larger companion. The
following different account of the nature of this alliance is more
credible:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whenever the pinna ventures to open its shell, it is immediately
exposed to the attacks of various of the smaller kinds of
fish, which, meeting with no resistance to their first assaults,
acquire boldness and venture in. The vigilant guard, by a
gentle bite, gives notice of this to his companion, who, upon
such a hint, closes her shell, and having thus shut them in
makes a prey of those who had come to prey upon her: when
thus supplied with food, she never fails to share her booty with
so useful an ally.</p>

<p>We are told that the sagacious observer, Dr. Hasselquist, in
his voyage, (about the middle of the last century,) to Palestine,
which he undertook for objects connected with the study of natural
history, beheld this curious phenomenon, which, although
well known to the ancients, had escaped the attention of the
moderns.</p>

<p>It is related by Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> that the pinna keeps a guard to
watch for her, which grows to her mouth, and serves as her
caterer: this he calls pinnophylax, and describes as a little fish
with claws like a crab. Pliny observes<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>, that the smallest species
of crab is called the pinnotores, and being from its diminutive
size liable to injury, has the prudence to conceal itself in
the shells of oysters. In another place he describes the pinna
as of the genus of shell-fish, with the further particulars that
it is found in muddy waters, always erect, and never without a
companion, called by some pinnatores, by others pinnophylax;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
this being sometimes a small squill, and at others a crab, which
remains with the pinna for the sake of food.</p>

<p>It is said that the pinna fastens itself so strongly to the rocks,
that the men employed in fishing for it are obliged to use considerable
force to break the tuft of threads by which it is secured
fifteen, twenty, and sometimes even thirty feet below the
surface of the sea.</p>

<p>It is fished up in the Gulf of Tarentum by the <i>Pernonico</i>,
which consists of two semicircular bars of iron fastened together
at the ends, at one of which is a wooden pole, at the other a
ring and cord. The fishermen conduct their boat over the
place, where the pinna is seen through the clear water, let
down the Pernonico, and, having loosened the pinna by embracing
it with the iron bars and twisting it round, draw it up
to the boat. The pinna is also obtained by diving. Poli, in
his splendid work on the Sicilian Testacea (<i>Parma</i>, 1795,
<i>folio</i>,) gives beautiful representations of the several species and
especially of the Pinna Nobilis<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. The following description of
submarine scenery and operations, is so vivid and pleasing that

<p>This species of Pinna is especially abundant on the shores of Sicily, in the
Gulf of Taranto, and in the Bay of Naples, particularly beyond the Cape of Posilipo.
It always fills my mind with the greatest delight to recollect the manner
of fishing for it, in which I have often taken a part at that spot in the commencement
of spring. On the northern shore of the Isle of Nisida opposite Posilipo,
is a most agreeable expanse of water, where the sea appears to be ever at
rest. Here, amidst those vast and most beauteous submarine forests, with which
the coast is decorated in every direction so as at once to charm the mind and refresh
the eye, the Pinna grows spontaneously in large groups, and in calm water,
when the shadows fall from the summit of the island, is clearly seen by persons
in boats growing nearly upright and fixed in the sandy bottom at the depth of
about thirty feet. There are divers, whose business it is to bring it up. But,
since it cannot be loosened even by repeated blows, (for the sand firmly resists
the attempts of the diver, being supported by its own weight and by the super-incumbent
water,) in these circumstances he sits down at the bottom of the sea,
brushes away with his fingers the earth which encompasses the shell, and then
endeavors to pull it up by seizing it with both hands. If he is thus likely to be
detained at the bottom for a longer time than he can hold his breath, he ascends
to the surface, supports himself <i>upon corks</i>, which are in readiness for him, and,
when he has sufficiently recovered himself by breathing, he again dives to the
bottom to complete his task.</p>
</div>

<p>The specimens of Pinna in the British Museum show not
only the tuft, but also the pearls and the mother of pearl. Poli
found in one specimen of the Pinna Nobilis no less than twenty
pearls, of which he has given figures in his splendid work.
Pliny (l. ix. c. 35.) mentions the practice of diving for the Pinna
in the Mediterranean Sea in order to obtain pearls from it:
and Athenæus (l. iii. p. 93 Casaub.) has preserved extracts from
two historical writers, one of whom accompanied Alexander on
his Indian expedition, and who informs us, that the Pinna was
procured in the Indian seas, by diving and for the sake of the
pearls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
The Italians call the fibres <i>Lana Pesce</i> or <i>Lana Penna</i>,
i. e. <i>Fish Wool</i>, or <i>Pinna Wool</i>. It is not equally good in all
places. When the bottom of the sea is sandy, the shell with
its bunch of fibres may be easily extracted, and they are silky
and of a fine color. But in rushy and muddy bottoms so fast
do they stick as to be generally broken in drawing up, and are
of a blackish color without gloss.</p>

<p>The Lana Penna is twice washed in tepid water, once in
soap and water, and again in tepid water, then spread on a table
to dry: while yet moist, it is rubbed and separated with the
hand, and again spread on the table. When quite dry, it is
drawn through a wide comb of bone, and then through a narrow
one. That which is destined for very fine works is also
drawn through iron combs, called <i>scarde</i> (<i>cards</i>). It is then
spun with a distaff and spindle.</p>

<p>As it is impossible to procure much of this material of a
good quality, the manufacture is very limited, and the articles
produced, stockings and gloves, are expensive. They are esteemed
excellent preservatives against cold and damp, are soft
and very warm, and the finest of a brown cinnamon, or glossy
gold color. The manufacture is chiefly carried on at Taranto,
the ancient <i>Tarentum</i><a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Lana Penna</i>, having been spun, is now almost universally
knit. But, as it does not appear that the ancients
were acquainted with this process prior to the second century,
whatever garments they made of this material must have been
woven.</p>

<p>The first proof we possess of its use among them is in Tertullian,
who lived in the second century (<i>De Pallio</i>, iii. <i>p.</i>
115, <i>Rigaltii</i>). Speaking of the materials for weaving, he
says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nec fuit satis tunicam pangere et serere, ni etiam piscari vestitum contigisset
nam et de mari vellera, quo mucosæ lanusitatis plautiores conchæ comant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Nor was it enough to comb and to sow the materials for a tunic. It was necessary
also to fish for one’s dress. For fleeces are obtained from the sea, where
shells of extraordinary size are furnished with tufts of mossy hair<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. (See Fig. 7,
<a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.</a>)</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_189" href="#FNanchor_189" class="label">[189]</a> In this passage <i>piscari</i> is rather fancifully opposed to <i>pangere</i> and <i>serere</i>.
The former of these two terms (<i>pangere</i>) refers to tunics of wool, which was <i>pacta</i>
or <i>pexa</i>; the latter to tunics of cotton and flax, which were <i>sata</i>. The epithet
<i>plautiores</i>, (etymologically allied to <i>latiores</i>, and to πλατὺς,) well describes the
large size and expanded form of the Pinna.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Procopius informs us (<i>De Edif. lib.</i> iii. <i>c.</i> 1.), that Armenia
was governed by five hereditary satraps, who received their
<i>insignia</i> from the Roman Emperor. Among these was a
Chlamys made of the fibres of the Pinna. (Χλαμὺς ἡ ἐξ ἐρίων
πεποιημένη, οὐχ οἷα τῶν προβατίων ἐκπέφυκεν, ἀλλ’ ἐκ θαλάσσης συνειλεγμένων· πίννους τὰ
ζῶα καλεῖν νενομίκασι, ἐν οἷς ἡ τῶν ἐρίων ἔκφυσις γίνεται.) This chlamys was
fastened with a fibula of gold, in which a precious stone was
set, and three hyacinths were suspended from it by golden
chains (χρυσαῖς τε καὶ χαλαραῖς ἀλύσεσιν.) The chlamys was accompanied
by a silken tunic, adorned with sprigs or “<i>feathers</i>” of
gold. It is thus described:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Χιτὼν ἐκ μετάξης, ἐγκαλλωπίσμασι χρυσοῖς πανταχόθεν ὡραΐσμενος, ἃ δὴ νενομίκασι
πλούμμια καλεῖν.</p>
</div>

<p>With the chlamys and tunic were worn boots of red leather,
such as only the emperors of Rome and Persia were allowed to
wear.</p>

<p>St. Basil mentions with admiration “the golden fleece” of
the Pinna, which no artificial dye could imitate.  Πόθεν τὸ χρυσοῦν
ἔριον αἱ πίνναι τρέφουσιν, ὅπερ οὐδεὶς τῶν ἀνθοβάφων ἐμιμήσατο.&mdash;<i>Hexaem.</i> vii.</p>

<p>Whether the tuft of the Pinna was used for weaving before
the time of the authors, who have now been cited, seems
doubtful. As the Pinna is frequently mentioned by earlier
writers, both Greek and Latin<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>, but without any reference to
the use of its tuft, it may be regarded as probable, that this
kind of cloth was not invented before the time of Tertullian.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="label">[190]</a> The passages are collected in Stephani Thesaurus L. Græcæ, ed. Valpy,
p. 7579.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>It is a no less curious question, Whence did the ancients obtain
the fibres of the Pinna, <i>and where was the manufacture
of them carried on</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
It has been commonly said at <i>Tarentum</i>, but apparently
for no other reason than that the Pinna is obtained and the
manufacture principally carried on at <i>Taranto</i> in modern
times. By referring to the authorities above quoted, it will be
seen that none of them makes any allusion to Tarentum.
Consequently we have no direct evidence, that this was the
seat of the ancient manufacture. On the contrary, we have
testimony, that fine cloths of this substance were made in
<i>India</i>, and thence imported into Greece and other countries.</p>

<p>The author of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, a document
of an age at least as late as the time of Tertullian, states
that the business of diving for the wool of the Pinna was prosecuted
near the city called <i>Colchi</i> in the south of India. Different
species of Pinna with tufts of fine silk are now no less
abundant in the Indian than the Mediterranean Sea. The
Periplus of the Erythrean Sea presents a sufficient proof, that
this beautiful substance was spun and woven by the Indians,
whereas we can only suppose from analogy that the manufacture
was carried on in ancient times by the Tarentines.</p>

<small>FIBRES, OR SILKEN MATERIAL OF THE PINE-APPLE.</small></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

weaving&mdash;Easy cultivation of the plant&mdash;Thrives where no other plant will
live&mdash;Mr. Frederick Burt Zincke’s patent process of manufacturing cloth from
the fibres of this plant&mdash;Its comparative want of strength&mdash;Silken material procured

manufactured generally by the Otaheiteans, and other inhabitants of the South
Sea Islands&mdash;Great strength (supposed) of ropes made from the fibres of the
aloe&mdash;Exaggerated statements.</p>
</div>

<p>This plant, which has hitherto been valued solely as ministering
to the luxuries of the table, has lately had a new interest
attached to it from the discovery of a fibre contained in
its leaves, possessing such valuable properties, that it will, in
all probability, soon form a new and important article of commerce.</p>

<p>The fibres of the pine-apple plant are disposed in fasciculi,
each apparent fibre being an assemblage of fibres adhering together,
of such exceeding delicacy, as only to measure from
1/5000th to 1/7000th part of an inch in diameter; viewed under the
microscope, they bear considerable resemblance to silk, from
their glossy, even, and smooth texture. They appear altogether
destitute of joints, or other irregularities, and are remarkably
transparent, particularly when viewed in water: they are very
elastic, of considerable strength, and readily receive the most
delicate dyes. This last fact appears singular, when we bear
in mind the resistance, if we may be allowed the expression,
which flax offers to dyes. With much trouble, and by long
processes, flax will receive a few dark dingy colors: all light
and brilliant ones it wholly resists; they do not enter the fibre,
but merely dry upon it externally, and afterwards easily peel,
or rub off,&mdash;in short, it may be said to be <i>painted</i>, and not
dyed.</p>

<p>The preparation of the pine-fibre is exceedingly simple. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
a leaf of this plant be examined, it will be found to consist of
an assemblage of fibres running parallel from one extremity of
the leaf to the other, embedded in the soft pabulum. All the
process necessary is to pass the leaf under a “tilt hammer,” the
rapid action of which, in a few seconds, completely crushes it,
without in the slightest degree injuring the fibre, which remains
in a large skein, and then requires to be rinsed out in
soft water, to cleanse it from impurities, and be afterwards dried
in the shade. So simple and rapid is the process, that a leaf, in
a quarter of an hour after being cut from the plant, may be in
a state fit for the purposes of the manufacturer, as a glossy,
white fibre, with its strength unimpaired by any process of maceration,
which, by inducing partial putrefaction, not only materially
injures the strength of flax, but also renders it of a
dingy color.</p>

<p>The pine-plant abounds both in the East and West Indies,
and may be easily propagated from the crown; offsets from
round the base of the fruit, which often amount to upwards of
twenty in number; and from the young plants which spring
from the parent stem; its cultivation requires but little care or
expense, and is of such hardy growth, as to be almost independent
of those casualties of weather, which often prove so detrimental
to more delicate crops&mdash;it is one of those plants which
Nature has scattered so profusely through tropical regions,
whose leaves are thick and fleshy, to contain a large supply of
nourishment, and covered by a thick, glazed cuticle; admitting
of so little evaporation, that many of them will thrive upon a
barren rock, where no other plant would live. Also from the
large portion of oxalic acid which the leaves contain, no animal
will touch them, and are, therefore, exempt from the trespasses
of cattle, &amp;c. Indeed no greater proof of the hardiness of the
plant can be given, than the fact, that in many places where
lands have been under tillage,&mdash;afterwards abandoned, and allowed
to return to a state of nature, the pine-apple plant exhibits
the only trace of former cultivation; every other cultivated
plant has died away before the encroachments of the surrounding wood,
while they alone remained increasing from year
to year, and spread into large beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
Mr. Frederick Burt Zincke obtained a patent in England,
bearing date December 9, 1836, for the following mode of preparing
the filaments of this plant, the “<i>Bromelia ananas</i>.”
We give the patentee’s own description (with slight emendations),
as received from the patent office, London, and which is
as follows.</p>

<p>“I (the said Frederick Burt Zincke) do hereby declare that
the nature of my said invention consists&mdash;Firstly, in preparing
or manufacturing the leaf of the plant, commonly called the
pine-apple, by bruising, beating, washing, and drying the same,
in such manner as to separate the long fibrous parts from the
cuticle pabulum, and other matter comprising the said leaf.
Secondly, in the application of the fibrous substance, so prepared
to various manufactures and purposes, for which silk, flax,
cotton, hemp, wool, and other fibrous materials are now used.
And further, I describe the manner in which my said invention
is to be performed by the following statement: For the purpose
of preparing the fibre, I cut the leaves from the pine-apple plant,
at any period from the time of their obtaining their full growth,
till the ripening of the fruit, for I find that if the leaves are
taken before they are full grown, the fibre is less strong, and if
suffered to remain on the plant, after the ripening of the fruit,
the fibre becomes harsh, and is more difficult to divest of the
extraneous matter. The small thorns having been trimmed
from the edge of the leaves, with a sharp knife, the leaves
should be crushed, so as to disengage the fibre from the other
matter composing the leaf, for which purpose the employment
of a mallet upon a block of wood, will fully answer the intended
purpose. This process of crushing is to be continued until
the fibre appears in an assemblage of long silky filaments,
with more or less of the pulpy and other matter of the leaf adhering
to them; to cleanse them from which they are to be
well rinsed in soft water, <i>immediately after having been
crushed</i> or beaten, and then the water should forthwith be
squeezed out of them, by drawing them between the edges of
two pieces of wood, placed parallel to each other, so as to admit
of the fibres being drawn out rather lightly between them, for
if the green matter is allowed to dry on the fibre, it of course
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
becomes more difficult to cleanse. The washing must be carefully
performed, so as to prevent the fibre from becoming tangled
or knotted. The operation of washing or rinsing must be repeated
until the fibre be thoroughly cleansed. If it be found
difficult to clean the fibre from the extraneous matter, in consequence
of not collecting the leaves from the plant sufficiently
early, or from any other cause, the operation will be facilitated
by boiling the fibre, after it has been beaten, and partially purified
in a solution of soap in soft water. For this purpose the
fibre must be regularly disposed in any suitable vessel, so as to
prevent its becoming tangled, with sufficient water to cover it,
in which soap has been dissolved, in the proportion of about
5 lbs. to 50 lbs. of fibre, a light weight being then placed upon it,
to keep the fibre beneath the surface of the liquor; the whole
is then to be boiled for the space of three or four hours, and after
boiling, to be well rinsed out in soft water, and squeezed as
before directed. The fibre having been cleansed by these processes,
is to be <i>gradually dried in the shade</i>, and occasionally
shaken out, so as to prevent the too close adhesion of the filament
in drying, which would otherwise take place. The fibre
may be obtained free from the extraneous matter of the leaf
by other modes; but I prefer that which I have above described.
As to the second part of my said invention, it is only necessary
to observe that from the <i>superiority of this fibre in several respects
over those now in common use</i>(?), it is adapted to a
vast number of purposes, in which fibrous materials are now
employed; it is of a glossy white color, it receives dyes with facility,
it possesses great strength, and is divisible to an exceeding
degree of fineness, for upon examination each filament
that appears a single fibre, is, in fact, a bundle of very delicate
fibres, adhering more or less strongly together. These qualities
render it applicable to the manufacture of <i>shawls</i>, <i>drills</i>, <i>damask-linens</i>,
<i>plushes</i>, <i>carpets</i>, <i>rugs</i>, <i>lace</i>, <i>bonnets</i>, <i>paper</i>; as a
material for <i>rope</i>, <i>twine</i>, or <i>thread</i>, and a variety of other purposes
to which silk, cotton, flax hemp, wool, and other fibrous
materials are now applied. As a material for spinning in the
ordinary method in which flax is now spun through hot water,
this fibre requires to undergo the process generally in use for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
bleaching flax. I find the period at which the bleaching can
be most conveniently performed, is when the fibre is in the
state called technically “a roving;” for the coarser yarns the
first stages of the bleaching process will be sufficient, but this
operation must be carried further, in proportion to the fineness
of the yarn intended to be spun. The effect of the bleaching
upon the fibre is, to disengage part of the adhesive matter,
which connects the fine filaments together, and render the
yarn susceptible of longation, between the receiving and delivering
rollers in spinning, after it has passed through the hot
water; I therefore claim as my invention, the preparing and
manufacturing into the fibres hereinbefore particularly described;
the leaf of the plant commonly called the pine-apple, by any
mode or modes of preparation, and also the application of the
said fibres, when prepared and manufactured, to the several
purposes hereinbefore also particularly specified, the same being
to the best of my knowledge (information, remembrance, and
belief), now and not heretofore practised.”</p>

<p>M. de la Rouverie affirms, that he procured a beautiful vegetable
silk from the Papyfera or paper mulberry; cutting the
bark while the tree was in sap, beating it with mallets, and
steeping it in water; he obtained a thread from the fibres, almost
equal to silk in quality; and this was woven into a cloth
the texture of which appeared as if formed of that material.
The finest sort of cloth among the inhabitants of Otaheite, and
other of the South Sea Islands, is made of the bark of this
tree.</p>

<p>According to M. Chevremont, Engineer of Mines, “ropes
made of aloes have <i>four times the resistance</i> of those of hemp
of the same diameter, and made by the same process(?). The
fibres of the aloe contain a resinous substance which protects
the ropes from the action of moisture: even at sea, and renders
the tarring of them unnecessary. They are lighter than hempen
ropes, and lose nothing of their strength by being wet(?).
When plunged into water, they are shortened only two per
cent., so that they become less rigid than ropes made of
hemp(?).”</p>

<p>There appears to be a good deal of exaggeration in regard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
to the great superiority of the fibres of these plants over cotton,
flax, &amp;c. This is particularly the case in regard to Mr. Zincke,
for although he succeeded in producing some very beautiful
specimens of fabric, in conformity with the foregoing specification,
yet, the manufacture does not appear to make much progress,
chiefly on account of the <i>inferiority in point of strength
of the cloth</i>, more especially when bleached.</p>

</div>

<p>The earliest mention of mallows is that given in the book
of Job, in the following words: “For want and famine they
were solitary: fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate
and waste. Who cut up <i>mallows</i> by the bushes, and <i>juniper-roots</i>
for their meat.”&mdash;Job xxx. 4.</p>

<p>We find in ancient authors of a more modern date, distinct
mention of three species of malvaceous plants, which are still
common in the South of Europe. These are, the Common
Mallow, <i>Malva Silvestris</i>, Linn.; the Marsh Mallow, <i>Althæa
Officinalis</i>, Linn.; and the Hempleaved Mallow, <i>Althæa Cannabina</i>,
Linn.</p>

<p>The Common Mallow is called by the Latin writers <i>Malva</i>,
by the Greek Μαλάχη, or Μολόχη.</p>

<p>This plant was used for food from the earliest times. Hesiod
represents living on Mallows and asphodel as the sign of
moderation, contentment, and simplicity of manners.</p>

<p>Fools! not to know how much more the half is than the whole, and how much
benefit there is in mallows and asphodel.</p>
</div>

<p>A dish of these vegetables was probably the cheapest of all
kinds of food; they grew wild in the meadow and by the wayside,
and were gathered and dressed without any labor or
trouble.</p>

<p>Various authors however mention the cultivation of the Common
Mallow in gardens. See Virgil, <i>Moretum</i>, 73. Pliny,
<i>Hist. Nat.</i> l. xix. c. 22 and 31. Isidori <i>Orig.</i> l. xvii. c. 10.
Papiæ <i>Vocabular.</i> v. <i>Malva. Geoponica</i>, xii. l. Palladuis, iii.
24. xi. ll.</p>

<p>Dioscorides (<i>l.</i> ii. c. III.) calls it the Garden Mallow. Aristophanes
(<i>Plutus</i> 544.) mentions eating the shoots of mallows
instead of bread, intending by this to represent a vile and destitute
kind of living. Plutarch (<i>Septem Sapientum Convivium</i>)
says, “The mallow is good for food, and the Anthericus
is sweet.” According to Le Clerc ὁ ἀνθέρικος (<i>Anthericus</i>)
means the scapus of the asphodel: if he is right, this plant was
eaten as we now eat asparagus. It is also remarkable that on
this supposition Plutarch mentions the same two plants, which
are also mentioned together by Hesiod.</p>

<p>According to Theophrastus (<i>Hist. Plant.</i> vii. 7. 2.) the mallow
was not eaten raw, as in a salad, but required to be cooked.
Cicero (<i>Epist. ad Fam.</i> vii. 26.) mentions the highly-seasoned
vegetables at a dinner given by his friend Lentulus. Having
been made ill by them, he says, that he, “who easily abstained
from oysters and lampreys, had been deceived by beet and
mallows.” Probably the leaves of the mallow were on this occasion
boiled, chopped, and seasoned, much in the same way
as spinach is now prepared in France.</p>

<p>Moschus in the following well-known lines refers to the common
mallow together with other culinary vegetables:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>This is accurately true of the common mallow, the root of
which is perennial, so that the stems grow up and die down
again every year. Accordingly Theophrastus brings it as an

<p>Without quoting other classical authorities, the ancient practice
may be illustrated by the observations of modern travellers,
who mention that the Common Mallow is still an article of consumption
in the same parts of the world.</p>

<p>Biddulph, who visited Syria about the year 1600, says, he
“saw near Aleppo many poor people gathering mallows, and
three-leaved grass, and asked them what they did with it, and
they answered, that it was all their food, and that they boiled
it, and did eat it.” (<i>Collection of Voyages and Travels from
the Library of the E. of Oxford</i>, <i>p.</i> 807.)</p>

<p>Dr. Sibthorp states, that the <i>Malva Silvestris</i> grows wild
in Cyprus, and is called Μόλωχα. He also says, “The wild mallow
is very common about Athens: the leaves are boiled and
eaten as a pot-herb, and an ingredient in the Dolma.” (<i>Memoirs
relating to European and Asiatic Turkey</i>, <i>edited by
Walpole</i>, <i>p.</i> 245.) Dr. Holland mentions both <i>Malva Silvestris</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
and <i>Althæa Officinalis</i> among the officinal plants, which
he found in Cephalonia. (<i>Travels in Greece</i>, <i>p.</i> 543, <i>4to.</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>Althæa Officinalis</i>, or Marsh Mallow, is called by the
Greek authors Ἀλθαία, by the Latin, Hibiscus. Theophrastus
says, that it went also under the name of wild mallow<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. Whilst
the Common Mallow, though highly esteemed for its medicinal
virtues, was principally regarded as a substantial article of food;
the Marsh Mallow, on the contrary, seems to have been rarely
used except as an article of the Materia Medica<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>; and, as its
peculiar properties were likely to be more matured in the wild
than cultivated state, it does not appear to have been grown in
gardens<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. Theophrastus describes it by comparing it with the
Common Mallow, and mentions its application, both internally
and externally, as a medicine<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. Dioscorides (<i>l.</i> iii. <i>c.</i> 139.) gives
similar details. Besides mentioning the proper name of the
plant in Greek and in Latin, he calls it, “a kind of wild mallow.”
Palladius (<i>l.</i> xi. <i>p.</i> 184. <i>Bip.</i>) explains “<i>Hibiscus</i>” to
be the same as “<i>Althæa</i>.” See also Pliny, <i>l.</i> xx. <i>c.</i> 14. <i>ed. Bip.</i>
Virgil alludes to the use of it as fodder for goats, and as a material
for <i>weaving baskets</i><a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</p>

<p>The Hemp-leaved Mallow, <i>Althæa Cannabina</i>, is once mentioned
by Dioscorides (<i>lib.</i> iii. <i>c.</i> 141.). Giving an account of
hemp, he distinguishes between the cultivated and the wild.
He says of the wild hemp, that the Romans called it <i>Cannabis
Terminalis</i><a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. After mentioning the medical properties of
the plant, Dioscorides says, that its bark was useful for making
ropes. The truth of this observation will be apparent to every
botanist. The plants belonging to the natural order <i>Malvaceæ</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
are all remarkable for the abundance of strong and beautiful
fibres in their bark<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197" class="label">[197]</a> Meaning literally Hedge-hemp.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_198" href="#FNanchor_198" class="label">[198]</a> We have the following testimony respecting the actual fabrication of mallow-cloth
in modern times:</p>

<p>“Nous avons vu à Madrid, chez le savant pharmacien D. Casimir Ortéga, de
ces tissus, qui nous ont semblé fort remarquables. Ils étaient faits avec l’écorce
des <i>Althéas officinalis</i> et <i>cannabina</i>, et avec celle du <i>Malva sylvestris</i>.” Fée,
Flore de Virgile, Paris 1822, p. 66.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>But of the European species there is none superior in the
fineness, the strength, the whiteness, and lustre of its fibres, to
the Common Mallow, the <i>Malva Silvestris</i>. We have seen
that the <i>ancients</i> were familiarly acquainted with this plant;
that it was commonly cultivated in their gardens; and that
they gathered it, when growing wild, to be taken as food or
medicine. In these circumstances they could scarcely fail to observe
the aptitude of its bark for being spun into thread. More
especially in places where they had no other native supply of
fibrous materials; in Attica, for example, which probably produced
neither hemp nor flax, it seems in the highest degree
probable, that the fitness of the mallow to supply materials for
weaving would not be overlooked.</p>

<p>In producing the evidence, which establishes this as a positive
fact, we shall begin with the latest testimonies and proceed
in a reverse order upward to the most ancient. According to
this plan, the first authority is that of Papias, who wrote his
Vocabulary about the year 1050. He gives the following explanations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Malbella vestis quæ ex malvarum stamine conficitur, quam alii molocinam vocant.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Molocina vestis quæ albo stamine sit: quam alii malbellam vocant.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These passages clearly describe a kind of cloth made of the
white fibres of the common mallow. <i>Malbella</i>, the same with
Malvella, is a Latin adjective, in the form of a diminutive, from
<i>Malva</i>: <i>Molocina</i>, the same with Μολόχινη, is a Greek adjective
from Μολόχη, and signifies <i>made of mallow</i>.</p>

<p>Papias, who seems in compiling his dictionary to have made
great use of Isidore, perhaps derived these explanations in part
from the following passage of the latter author:</p>
 <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Melocinia</i> (vestis est), quæ malvarum stamine conficitur, quam alii <i>molocinam</i>,
alii <i>malvellam</i> vocant. <i>Isid. Hisp. Orig.</i> xix. 22.</p>

<p>The cloth called <i>Melocinea</i> is made of the thread of mallows, and is called by
some <i>Molocina</i>, by others <i>Malvella</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The passages of Papias cannot be taken as a proof, that mallow-cloth
was woven in his day. But that it was in fashion
as late as the age of Charlemagne appears from the following
line, which is quoted by Du Cange (<i>Glossar. Med. et Inf.
Lat. v. Melocineus</i>) from a poem in praise of that monarch,
attributed to Alcuin:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tecta melocineo fulgescit femina amictu.</p>

<p>Wrapt in a mallow shawl the lady shines.</p>
</div>

<p>The word “<i>fulgescit</i>” aptly describes the lustre of the material
under consideration. From the Periplus of the Erythrean
Sea<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> we learn, that <i>cloths made of mallow</i>, were among the
articles of export from India, being brought from Ozene (Ugain)
and Tagara in the interior of the country to the sea-port of
Barygaza (Baroch). P. 146. 169, 170, 171.</p>

</div>

<p>The genus <i>Hibiscus</i>, Linn. is very abundant in India. The
bark of a certain species of this genus, especially of H. <i>Tiliaceus</i>
and H. <i>Cannabinus</i>, is now very extensively employed
for making <i>cordage</i>, and might unquestionably have been used
for making cloth<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_200" href="#FNanchor_200" class="label">[200]</a> Cavanilles, Tab. 52, fig. 1, represents H. Cannabinus, the leaf of which is
like that of hemp. Tab. 55, fig. 1, represents H. Tiliaceus, in the description of
which we read “<i>cortice in funes ductili</i>;” and Cavanilles says, the inhabitants
of the South Sea Islands (<i>Australium insularum</i>) use in their ships and boats
ropes made from the bark.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>H. <i>Tiliaceus</i> is also represented in Rheede’s Hort. Malabaricus
(vol. i. fig. 30.). It grows about 15 feet high.</p>

<p>Dr. Wallich (Cat. of Indian Woods, p. 18.) mentions two
other species as used for making cordage from the bark.</p>

<p>The late Mr. John Hare, who lived in India a long time,
says, that a coarse kind of cloth, used for making sacks, &amp;c.,
is now woven from Hibiscus bark.</p>

<p>As a further evidence, that the <i>Molochina</i> mentioned in the
Periplus were made from the bark of the Hibiscus, we may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
refer to that admirable specimen of Eastern taste and ingenuity,
the Sacontăla of the great Indian dramatist Calidāsa. Several
passages of this poem make mention of the <i>Valcăla</i>, which
the Sanscrit Lexicons, themselves of great antiquity, explain as
meaning either bark, or a vesture made from it. We learn
from Dr. Wallich, a celebrated Indian botanist, that many
kinds of Hibiscus had this quality in an eminent degree, and,
as their bark was in common use for making all kinds of cordage,
it might undoubtedly be employed for weaving.</p>

<p>The Sacontăla is of a date as ancient as the Periplus. Professor
Von Bohlen (<i>Das alte Indien</i>, <i>vol.</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 477.) asserts,
that the author Calidāsa certainly flourished as early as the
first century B. C. Sir William Jones makes him older by
several centuries. (<i>Works</i>, <i>vol.</i> vi. <i>p.</i> 206.) The place also
agrees as well as the time. The Hibiscus Tiliaceus, according
to Sir J. E. Smith, is “one of the most common trees in every
part of the East Indies, thriving in all sorts of situations and
soils, and cultivated for the sake of its shade even more than
the beauty of its flowers, in towns and villages and by road-sides.
A coarse cordage,” he adds, “is made of the bark; the
wood is light and white, useful for small cabinet-work; the
mucilage of the whole plant is applied to some medical purposes.”
The Molochina, mentioned in the Periplus, were
brought from Ozene and Tagara, and may have come from
still further North. The hermitage, described in the drama,
was at the foot of the Himalaya Mountains, and near the river
Malina, and, according to the representations given by the poet,
the Valcălas (translated by Sir W. Jones “<i>mantles of woven
bark</i>,” and by Chézy, “<i>vêtemens d’écorce</i>”), were worn both
by the hermits and by the beautiful Sacontăla, while she was
their inmate<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.</p>

<p>“Valcălas” are mentioned in precisely the same manner in

by ascetics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
If the explanation now given be admitted as applicable to
the Molochina of the Periplus, it may throw light upon some
other passages of ancient authors.</p>

<p>Ctesias, in his <i>Indica</i><a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>, mentions “<i>sheets made from trees</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Strabo’s account of the webs, which he calls <i>Serica</i>, an account
derived from the writings of Nearchus, admiral of Alexander
the Great, represents those webs as made from fibres,
<i>which were scraped from the bark of trees</i>. This would apply
exactly to the supposed use of the Hibiscus for making cloth.
The bark must have been first stript from the tree, and the
fibres then scraped from the <i>inside of the bark</i>.</p>

<p>To the same source we may, we think, trace the idea of
Arethas (<i>in Apoc.</i> <i>c.</i> 57.), that the Byssus, Rev. xix. 8., was
“<i>the bark of an Indian tree made into flax</i>.”</p>

<p>Although the date of the following inscription, found at
Rome, is uncertain, it may be conveniently brought in here.
It is published by Muratori, <i>Novus Thesaurus Vet. Inscriptionum</i>,
<i>tom.</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 939.</p>

<p class="center">P. AVCTIVS P. L. LYSANDER.
VESTIARIVS. TENVIARIVS.

</p>

<p>Muratori in his Note says, that “Vestiarius Tenuiarius” was
the man who made thin garments, and “<i>Molochinarius</i>” the
man who made such garments of a mallow color.</p>

<p>The authors, next in regard to antiquity, who make mention
of <i>Molochina</i>, are the writers of the Latin Comedy, Statius
Cæcilius, who died 169 B. C., and Plautus, who died 184 B. C.</p>

<p>Nonius Marcellus (<i>l.</i> xvi.) quotes the following line from the
<i>Pausimachus</i> of the former dramatist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Carbasina, molochina, ampelina.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

Statius chiefly copied Menander (<i>Gellius</i>, ii. <i>c.</i> 16.); but it is not certain that
Menander wrote any play called <i>Pausimachus</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>The passage of Plautus is in the Aulularia (<i>Act</i> iii. <i>Scene</i> v.
<i>l.</i> 40.), where we have a ludicrous enumeration, extending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
through more than ten lines, of all the persons concerned in
the manufacture or sale of garments.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Solearii astant, astant molochinarii.</p>
</div>

<p>All the lexicographers and commentators explain <i>Molochinarius</i>
to be one who dyes cloth of the color of the mallow.
<i>Lanarius</i> was a woollen-draper; <i>Coactiliarius</i>, a dealer in
felts, a hatter; <i>Lintearius</i> a linen-draper; and <i>Sericarius</i> a
silk-mercer. According to the same analogy, <i>Molochinarius</i>
would mean <i>a dealer in Molochina</i>, i. e. <i>in all kinds of cloth
made from mallows</i>.</p>

<p>The class of writers, which will now be produced as affording
testimony respecting the use of the mallow for weaving,
are Greek authors, and who instead of the common Greek
terms employ the Attic term Ἀμοργὸς and its derivatives.</p>

<p> Ἀμοργὸς has been explained by some of the lexicographers
to be a kind of flax (See Julius Pollux, L. vii. § 74.). Perhaps
by this explanation nothing more was intended than that it
was a plant, the fibres of which were used to spin and weave
into cloth. It is highly probable that it was the <i>Malva Silvestris</i>
or <i>Common Mallow</i>, and that it was called Ἀμοργὸς.</p>

<p>According to the Attic lexicons of Pausanias (<i>apud Eustath.
l. c.</i>) and of Mœris, Ἀμοργὸς was an Attic term. We now find
traces of it in seven Attic writers, four or five of whom wrote
comedy. These are Aristophanes, Cratinus, Antiphanes, Eupolis,
Clearchus, Æschines, and Plato.</p>

<p>I. We shall take first Aristophanes, whose comedy called
Lysistrata is frequently quoted by Pausanias and Cratinus, and
being still extant throws considerable light upon the subject. It
was represented in the year 412. B. C. Lysistrata says (<i>l.</i>
150),</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Κᾂν τοῖς χιτώνιοισι τοῖς ἁμόργινοις</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Γυμναὶ παριοῖμεν,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“And if we should present ourselves naked in shifts of amorgos;”
showing that these shifts were transparent. Accordingly
Mœris says, that the ἀμόργινον was λεπτὸν ὕφασμα, “a thin web.” Bisetus
in his Greek commentary on this play, after quoting the
explanations of Stephanus Byzantinus, Suidas, Eustathius,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
and the Etymologicum Magnum, judiciously concludes as follows:
“From all these it is manifest, that ἀμόργινοι χιτώνες,
whether they took their name from a place, from their color, or
from the raw material, were a kind of valuable robe, worn by
the rich, fashionable, and luxurious women.”</p>

<p>A subsequent passage of the Lysistrata (v. 736-741) still
further illustrates this subject. A woman laments, that she has
left at home her ἀμοργις <i>without being peeled</i> (ἄλοπον), and she
goes <i>to peel it</i> (ἀποδείρειν). The mallow no less than flax and
hemp, would require the bark to be stript off, and doubtless the
best time for stripping it is as soon as the plant is gathered.</p>

<p>II. Cratinus died about 420 B. C. The following line, from
his comedy called Μαλθακοὶ, represents a person spinning Ἀμοργός.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Ἀμοργὸν ἔνδον βρυτίνην νήθειν τινα.</p>

<p><i>Cratina Fragmenta, a Runkel</i>, <i>p.</i> 29.</p>
</div>

<p>III. Julius Pollux, speaking of garments made of Ἀμοργὸς (L.
vii. c. 13.) quotes the Medea of Antiphanes thus:  Ἦν χιτὼν
ἁμόργινος. This author was contemporary with Aristophanes.</p>

<p>IV. Eupolis wrote about the same time, and his authority
may be added to the rest as proving that garments of Amorgos
were admired by luxurious persons at Athens<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>V. Clearchus of Soli<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> mentions the use of a cover of Amorgos
for inclosing a splendid purple blanket. This application
of it is agreeable to the foregoing evidence, showing that the
<i>amorgine webs were transparent</i>. The silky translucence of
the lace-like web of mallow would have a very beautiful effect
over the fine purple of the downy blanket.</p>

years later than the before-mentioned authors, but the circumstances related by
him may have occurred about the time when those authors flourished, and even
at Athens.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>VI. Æschines in an oration against Timarchus, the object
of which is to hold up to contempt the extravagancies of this
Athenian spendthrift, in his enumeration of them, he mentions
(p. 118, ed. Reiskii.) that Timarchus took to his house a “woman
skilled in making cloths of Amorgos.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
VII. Plato in the 13th Epistle, addressed to Dionysius, tyrant
of Syracuse, which, if not genuine, is at least ancient,
proposes to give to the three daughters of Cebes three long
shifts, not the valuable shifts made of Amorgos, but the linen
shifts of Sicily.</p>

<p>The mention of amorgine garments by the writers, who
have now been cited, seems to prove, that the fashion of making
and wearing them first came in among the Greeks at Athens
in the time of Aristophanes, who lived, as the reader will have
observed, in the fifth century before Christ. From them the
fashion may have extended itself into Sicily and Italy, which
will account, if <i>Amorgina</i> were the same with <i>Molochina</i>,
for the striking agreement in this respect between the writers
of Greek and of Latin Comedy. In subsequent ages the manufacture
seems to have declined, probably in consequence of
the abundance of silk and other rich and beautiful goods imported
from Asia. But the mention of these stuffs in the writings
of Isidore and Alcuin renders it probable, that they were
brought again into use in the fifth and following centuries of
the Christian era.</p>

<p>Pliny says, that “in the part of Hispania Citerior about
New Carthage whole mountains were covered with Spartum;
that the natives made mattresses, shoes, <i>and coarse garments
of it</i>, also fires and torches; and that its tender tops were eaten
by animals<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.” He also says, that it grows spontaneously
where nothing else will grow, and that it is “the rush of a dry
soil.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>The question now arises, what plant Pliny intended to describe.
Clusius, who travelled in Spain chiefly with a view to
botany, supposed Pliny’s “Spartum” to be the tough grass,
used in every part of Spain for making mats, baskets, &amp;c.,
which Linnæus afterwards called Stipa Tenacissima<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>. It is
not surprising, that the opinion of so eminent a botanist as
Clusius has been generally adopted. It is, however, far
more probable, that the plant, which Pliny intended to speak
of, was the Spartium Junceum, <i>Linn.</i>, so familiarly known
under the name of Spanish Broom.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>

<p>In the first place, the name <i>Spartum</i> should be considered as
decisive of the question, unless some sufficient reason can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
shown for ascribing to it in this passage a sense different from
that which it commonly bore. <i>Spartus</i> or <i>Spartum</i>, is admitted
to be used by all authors, Greek and Latin, and even
by Pliny himself in another passage<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>, to denote the Spanish
Broom. We learn from Sibthorp, that the Spanish Broom is
still called <i>Sparto</i> by the Greeks, and that it grows on dry
sandy hills throughout the islands of the Archipelago and the
continent of Greece. <i>Sparto</i> was indeed properly the Greek
name of this shrub, the Latin name being <i>Genista</i>, and the
use of the Greek name in Hispania Citerior may have been
owing to the Grecian settlements on that coast, colonized from
Marseilles.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_208" href="#FNanchor_208" class="label">[208]</a> See L. xi. 8. where Pliny says, that bees obtain honey and wax from
“Spartum,” and compare this with Aristotle, Hist. Anim. L. x. 40.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Besides the passages of Latin authors referred to by Schneider
and Billerbeck, and which it is unnecessary to repeat, the
following from Isidore of Seville appears decisive respecting the
acceptation of the term.</p>

<p>“Spartus frutex virgosus sine foliis, ab asperitate vocatus;
volumina enim funium, quæ ex eo fiunt, aspera sunt.” <i>Originum</i>
L. xvii. <i>c.</i> 9.</p>

<p>This is the definition of a learned and observant author, who
lived in Spain, and who must have been familiar with the
facts. “<i>Frutex virgosus sine foliis</i>” is a clear and striking
description of the Spanish Broom, the leaves of which are so
small as easily to escape observation<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. The Stipa Tenacissima,
on the other hand, is not a shrub with twigs, but a grass,
which grows in tufts, the long leaves being as abundant and
useful as the stems or straws. Clusius himself (<i>l. c.</i>) in laying
down the distinction between the Spartum of the Greeks,
which he supposed to be the Spanish Broom, and the Spartum
of Pliny, which he supposed to be the Stipa Tenacissima, asserts
that the former is a shrub (<i>frutex</i>), the latter a herb with
grassy leaves (<i>herba graminacea folia proferens</i>). It is clear,
therefore, that the inhabitants of Spain in the time of Isidore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
still used the term <i>Spartus</i> in its original acceptation, viz. to
denote the Spartium Junceum of Linnæus.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_209" href="#FNanchor_209" class="label">[209]</a> Dioscorides also describes the Spanish Broom to be “a shrub bearing long
twigs without leaves.” Isidore’s etymology, deducing Spartus from Asper, is manifestly
absurd.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>When the Stipa Tenacissima was brought into use for making
ropes and for other purposes, for which the Spanish Broom
was employed, the name of the latter would naturally be extended
to the former, and we may thus account for the fact
that the Stipa Tenacissima is now universally known in Spain
by the name <i>Esparto</i>. Indeed it is possible, that the employment
of the Stipa Tenacissima for these purposes may have
been as ancient as the time of Pliny; and his use of the word
“<i>herba</i>” in describing it, as well as the locality which he assigns
to it, the hilly country about Carthage, favors the common
interpretation, and perhaps even authorizes the conclusion, that
his account is the result of confounding the two plants together,
so that he says of one supposed plant things, which were partly
true of both, and partly applicable either to the Spanish Broom,
or to the Stipa Tenacissima only. But, even if this be admitted,
it is still possible that the plant, from whose fibres the
“<i>pastorum vestis</i>” was manufactured, was not the grassy Stipa,
but the shrub, the Spanish Broom.</p>

<p>In order to establish this point we now proceed to mention the
evidence respecting the application of it to such uses. It has
been employed for making cloth in Turkey, in Italy, and the
South of France, but in circumstances, which were either specially
favorable to the manufacture, or where flax could not be
cultivated. It is manufactured into shirts in Albania according
to Dr. Sibthorp<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. Nearly a century ago, Pope Benedict XIV.
brought a colony of Albanians to inhabit a barren and desolate
portion of his territory on the sea-coast. Here they obtained a
very fine, strong, durable thread from the Broom and the <i>Nettle</i>,
and used it, when woven, in place of linen<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. Trombelli,
who relates this fact, also gives an account of the manufacture
of broom-bark in the vicinity of Lucca, where the hills, called
Monte Cascia, are covered with this plant<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. “Formerly,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
says, “the people derived no other advantage from the shrub
than to feed sheep and goats with it, and to heat their stoves
and furnaces. But their ingenuity and industry have now
made it far more profitable. They steep the twigs for some
days in the thermal waters of Bagno a Acqua near Lucca.
<i>After this process the bark is easily stript off, and it is then
combed and otherwise treated like flax.</i> It becomes finer
than hemp could be made; it is easily <i>dyed</i> of <i>any</i> color, and
may be used for garments of <i>any</i> kind<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.” In the vicinity of
Pisa we find that the twigs of the Spanish Broom were in like
manner soaked in the thermal waters, and that a coarse cloth
was manufactured from the bark<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>But the manufacture has been carried to a far greater extent
in the South of France. In the <i>Journal de Physique</i>, <i>Tom.</i>
30. <i>4to.</i> An. 1787. p. 294., is a paper by <i>Broussonet Sur la
culture et les usages économiques du Genêt d’Espagne</i>. A
minute and highly curious account is here given of the mode
of preparing the fibres, which is practised by the inhabitants of
all the villages in the vicinity of Lodêve in Bas Languedoc.
The shrub abounds on the barren hills of that region, and all
that the people do to favor its growth is to sow the seed in the
driest places, where scarce any other plant can vegetate. After
being cut, the twigs are dried in the sun, then beaten, macerated
in water, and treated in the same way as flax or hemp
(See Zincke’s process, <a href="#Chapter1_XI">Chapter XI.</a>). The coarser thread is
used to make bags for holding the legumes, corn, &amp;c.; the
finer for making <i>sheets</i>, <i>napkins</i>, and <i>shirts</i>. The peasants in
this district use <i>no other kind of linen</i>, not being acquainted
with the culture either of flax or hemp. The ground is too
dry and unproductive to suit these plants. The linen made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
of the Spanish Broom is as supple as that made from hemp;
it might be even as beautiful as real linen, if more pains were
taken with it. It becomes whiter, the oftener it is washed. It
is rarely sold, each family making it for its own use. The
stalks, after the rind has been separated from them, are tied in
small bundles, and sold for lighting fires.</p>

<p>Let us now see how far Pliny’s account of the Spartum
agrees with these representations of the mode of manufacturing
Broom-bark. The Spartum, of which he speaks, is “<i>the
rush of a dry soil</i>,” a description far more applicable to the
young twigs of the Spanish Broom than to the grassy stems
of the Stipa Tenacissima, or indeed to any other plant. His
Spartum was used for making fires and for giving light (<i>hinc
ignes facesque</i>), purposes for which the Stipa Tenacissima is
not at all adapted, but to both of which the stems and twigs of
the Spanish Broom are applied. The tender tops of Pliny’s
Spartum served as food for animals. According to Trombelli
sheep and goats feed upon the Spanish Broom in Italy;
but we cannot find that this is the case with the Stipa Tenacissima.
Pliny’s Spartum, after being steeped in water, was
beaten in order to be made useful (<i>Hoc autem tunditur, ut
fiat utile</i>); and this process was quite necessary in preparing
the twigs of Spanish Broom, whereas the Stipa Tenacissima
is most commonly manufactured without going through any
such process. Clusius indeed states (<i>l. c.</i>) that by macerating
it in water like flax, and then drying and beating it, the Spaniards
of Valencia make a kind of shoes, which they call <i>Alpergates</i>,
also cords, and other finer articles; but, at the same
time, he says, that it is made into mats, baskets, ropes, and
cables, merely by being dried, platted, and twisted, without any
other operation. The same account is given by Townsend,
who visited the country as late as 1787, and who further states,
that “the esparto rush” had latterly “been spun into fine thread
for the purpose of making cloth<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.” It seems, however, that this
had only been done as an experiment, whereas the accounts
which have been quoted show, that the manufacture of cloth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
from broom-bark had been long established in Albania, Italy,
and the South of France. In the latter district more especially,
the entire dependence of the people on this material as a substitute
for flax and hemp, and the primitive mode in which this
domestic manufacture was carried on in a retired and mountainous
region, seem to indicate the high antiquity of the practice.
All the other authors, who mention the use of the Stipa
Tenacissima, certainly give little countenance to the idea of its
fitness to supply a thread for making cloth. Mr. Carter, adopting
the common opinion that the Spartum of Pliny is the Stipa
Tenacissima, observes, that “at present the meanest Spaniard
would think clothing made from this grass very rough and uncomfortable<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.”
We shall only quote one other authority, that
of Löfling, the favorite pupil of Linnæus, who became botanist
to the King of Spain, and whose Iter Hispanicum (<i>Stockholm</i>,
1758.) relates particularly to the plants of that country. He
follows Clusius in supposing the Spartum of Pliny to be the
Stipa Tenacissima of Linnæus. He mentions, that its stem is
two or three feet high, with leaves so long, thin, tough, and
convoluted, that they are admirably adapted for the purposes
to which they are applied. He adds, “Hispanis nominatur
Esparto. Usus hujus frequentissimus per universam Hispaniam
ad storeas ob pavimenta lateritia per hyemem: ad funes
crassiores pro navibus ad que corbes et alia utensilia pro transportandis
fructibus.” (<i>p.</i> 119.)</p>

<p>Pliny’s remark, that the Spartum, of which he speaks, could
not be sown (<i>quæ non queat seri</i>), is not true of the Spanish
Broom; but this is of little importance in the present inquiry,
because it is coupled with the remark, that nothing else could
be sown in the same situation (<i>nec aliud ibi seri aut nasci
potest</i>); a remark, which is totally unfounded in fact. The
Spanish Broom would unquestionably be propagated by its
seed, which is very abundant.</p>

<p>From these facts, the reader will have no difficulty in forming
his decision. Notwithstanding the respect due to the authority
of Clusius, into which that of all the subsequent writers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
seems to resolve itself, it appears to us that the evidence preponderates
against the use of Stipa Tenacissima for making
cloth in ancient times, and points to the conclusion, that the
coarse garments, to which Pliny alludes, were fabricated from
the fibrous rind of Spartium Junceum.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting facts in the geography of plants
is the frequent substitution in one country, of a plant of a certain
natural order for another of the same natural order in another
country. The Indians have a plant, bearing a very close
and striking resemblance to the Spartium Junceum, which
they employ just as the natives of Bas Languedoc employ that
plant. We refer to the Crotalaria Juncea, called by the natives
Goni, Danapu, or Shanapu, and by us the Sun-plant, or Indian
Hemp. From the bark are made all kinds of ropes, packing-cloths,
sacks, nets, &amp;c. In order to improve the fibre, the
plants are sown as close as possible and thus draw up to the
height of about ten feet. According to Dr. Francis Buchanan,
the plant thrives best on a poor sandy soil, and requires to be
abundantly watered. After being cut down it is spread out to
the sun and dried. The seed is beaten out by striking the
pods with a stick. After this the stems are tied up in large
bundles, about twelve feet in circumference, and are preserved
in stacks or under sheds. When wanted, the stems are macerated
during six or eight days. They are known to be ready,
when the bark separates easily from the pith. “The plant is
then taken out of the water, and a man, taking it up by handfuls,
beats them on the ground, and occasionally washes them
until they be clean; and at the same time picks out with his
hand the remainder of the pith, until nothing except the bark
be left. This is then dried, and being taken up by handfuls,
is beaten with a stick to separate and clean the fibres. The
hemp is then completely ready, and is spun into thread on a
spindle, both by the men and women. The men alone weave
it, and perform this labor in the open air with a very rude
loom.” The fabric made from it is a coarse, but very strong
sack-cloth.</p>

<p>“The fibres, when prepared,” says Ironside, “are so similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
to hemp, that Europeans generally suppose them to be the
produce of the same plant<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.”</p>

vol. iii. p. 259-263.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Lupinus</i> (<i>the Lupin</i>), belonging to the same natural order as Spartium
and Crotalaria, might probably afford materials of the same kind. Mr.
Strange (<i>Lettera</i>, &amp;c. p. 70.) mentions the filamentous substance of the Lupin <i>as
adapted for making paper</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Theophrastus<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> (Hist. Pl. viii. 13.) gives the following account
of a bulbous plant, called by him Βολβὸς ἐριοφόρος, the root of
which supplied materials for weaving:&mdash;“It grows in <i>bays</i>,
and has the wool under the first coats of the bulb so as to be
between the inner eatable part and the outer. Socks and other
garments are woven from it. Hence this kind is woolly, and
not hairy, like that in India.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_218" href="#FNanchor_218" class="label">[218]</a> “Theophrastus relates, that there is a kind of bulb growing about the banks of
rivers, and that between its outer rind and the part of it which is eaten there is a
woolly substance, out of which they make certain kinds of socks and cloths. But
in the copies which I have found, he neither mentions in what country this is
done, nor anything else with greater exactness, except that the bulb is called
<i>eriophoros</i>; nor does he make any mention at all of spartum, although he examined
the whole subject with great care 390 years before my time, as I have observed
in another place (Viz., lib. xv. 1.), from which circumstance it appears,
that spartum came into use since that time.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to determine what plant is meant, though the
description seems accurate and scientific. Billerbeck absurdly
supposes it to be cotton-grass<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. By former botanists, men of
great eminence, it was supposed to be Scilla Hyacinthoides.
Sprengel objects, that this species does not grow in Greece<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.
Sir James Smith however (<i>article</i> <span class="smcap">Scilla</span> in <i>Rees’s Cyclop.</i>)
represents it as growing in Madeira, Portugal, and the Levant.
If this account be true, Theophrastus may have been acquainted
with it. In another article, Eriophorus, Sir J. Smith doubts
whether either Scilla Hyacinthoides or any other bulb produces
wool of such quality and in such quantity as to answer the
description of Theophrastus. But, we learn from other well-informed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
botanists, that various bulbs have under the outermost
coats a copious tissue of tough fibres, <i>fully sufficient</i> to
be employed in <i>weaving</i>. This is particularly the case with
the genera <i>Amaryllis</i>, Crinum, and <i>Pancratium</i>, as well as
<i>Scilla</i>. The fibrous coats serve as a protection to the interior
and more vital parts of the bulb.</p>

<p>Sonnini says of the Scilla Maritima, “The Greeks of the
Archipelago call it Kourvara-skilla, <i>kourvara</i> signifying properly
a ‘tuft of thread’ (<i>peloton de fil</i><a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>).” Does this refer to the
fibres mentioned by Theophrastus? The <i>size</i> of this bulb,
which is the common squill, used in pharmacy, seems to favor
this supposition. It is often as large as a man’s head<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. Hoffmansegg
and Link<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> say it grows abundantly on barren hills
in Spain and Portugal; but add, “The name <i>maritima</i> is
not quite proper: for the plant is seldom met with near the
sea-shore, and sometimes very remote from it.” On the other
hand, it must have been so called, because it was reported by
others to grow on the sea-shore; and Sir James Smith (<i>in
Rees’s Cyclopedia</i>) expressly states, that it grows on “sandy
shores.” Redouté says the same.</p>

may have been a bulb, such as Theophrastus describes,

having similar properties. Perhaps he alluded to some plant of

<div class="blockquot">

<i>Northampton, Hampshire County, Mass.</i><br />
</p>

<p>“Dear Sir: The favorable notice of silk culture in document
No. 109, from the Patent Office report of February, 1843, is my
apology for presenting the enclosed samples of <i>paper</i>, made of
mulberry foliage and bark. Unfortunately, the <i>external cuticle</i>
of the bark had not been removed; producing the spots, but
does not injure the paper for the use intended, which was for
the purpose of depositing silk-worms’ eggs upon something
dark; and this being <i>unbleached</i>, is considered adapted to the
habits of the silk-worm, and is now in successful experiment.</p>

<p>“The four samples are all of one batch; the darkest, having
more of the outside cuticle, was most buoyant, rose to the top
and came off first.</p>

<p>“A quantity of genuine Canton foliage, which retains its
verdure in greater perfection and later than any other mulberry,
is gathered, dried, and sent to the mill for making paper,
bleached, without spots, fit for cotton paper, as hoped; and, if
successful, I shall take pleasure in sending you a sample, to be
preserved with the enclosed.</p>

<p>“I began, some ten or twelve years since, to bring silk culture
into notice among the members of the Hampshire Agricultural
Society, believing that if we tried the right kind of trees,
(such as used in China,) we could raise silk, yet could not afford
to pay $1 per tree, as then asked for multicaulis; not reflecting
how easily they could be propagated by cuttings and
layers. Under this view of the subject, I wrote to the Rev. E.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
C. Bridgman, missionary at Canton, China, a native of Hampshire
county, with the request that he would procure and forward
me some <i>mulberry seed</i> of the most approved kind for
growing in China, for the use of members of the agricultural
society. He promptly attended to the request; the seed was
forwarded and sown in the spring of 1834 or 1835. It grew
finely, and developed a splendid leaf.</p>

<p>“About two years since, while Dr. Parker, with a Chinaman,
was here on a visit, on being shown the Canton foliage, it was
readily recognized. As the trees had grown here very luxuriantly,
and developed a larger leaf than in China, Dr. Parker
suggested that our soil might be more congenial to the plant
than even China, its native soil.</p>

<p>“Soon after receiving the seed from Canton, a friend sent
me another parcel from the South of Asia, with high commendations,
that if it would grow here, it would be of essential benefit
to the United States for raising silk. It succeeded well, and
is more hardy than the white mulberry, very productive in
small branches, and a good-sized leaf. I named the latter
<i>Asiatic Canton</i>. These two kinds are highly approved of for
feeding silk-worms&mdash;the Canton for leaf-feeding, and the Asiatic
for branch feeding. I have, however, almost every variety
which was cultivated during the mulberry speculation&mdash;covering,
altogether, some ten or twelve acres, besides a large number
of young Canton and Asiatic seedlings, of this year’s sowing,
from seed of my own raising, to enlarge the plantations.</p>

<p>“A few days since, the Rev. William Richards, of the Sandwich Islands,
with the young prince, called on me. At a former
visit, I had supplied him with Canton mulberry-seed, silk-worms’
eggs, and dry mulberry foliage to use in case the eggs
should hatch on the passage; but this they did not do until his
arrival home. About the same time, other eggs had been received
there from China; but the cocoons raised from them
were not <i>one quarter</i> as large as the American, and must have
required some 10,000 to 12,000 to make a pound of silk, while
in America 2,400 to 3,000 would make a pound.</p>

<p>“Mr. Titcomb, also a silk-grower in one of the islands, having
the American and Chinese, crossed them: but the crossing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
produced cocoons so small as to require from 5,000 to 6,000 to
make a pound of silk, while not over 3,000 of the American
would be required to do the same thing(!).</p>

<p>“Mr. Richards was shown several <i>pamphlets</i>, <i>newspapers</i>,
<i>cap</i> and <i>writing paper</i>, supposed to have been made of mulberry
bark. He said rags were <i>not</i> used in India<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, China, or
the islands, for making paper, but they always make it of some

<p>“We, as Americans, have the appropriate soil and climate for
the Canton and Asiatic mulberry, with the pea-nut variety of
worms, which, being managed with due care and attention,
together with the skill, ingenuity, and perseverance of Americans&mdash;and,
in addition, and could we have the aid of our country
to encourage new beginners&mdash;we might hope to compete with
any nation in the production of silk, their cheap labor and
cheap living to the contrary notwithstanding. There is abundant
evidence that worms fed exclusively on the Canton mulberry
have been larger, and produced heavier cocoons, by one-third
in size of worms and weight of cocoons, than by other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
feed. I have supplied an order of the peanut variety of eggs,
to go to Guatemala; and Canton seed, of my own raising, to
go to Rio; and now have an order for a number of the genuine
Canton mulberry trees, roots, or cuttings, to go to Lima,
where the applicant went on business, a few years since, taking
with him a few multicaules, at $2 each&mdash;now multiplied to
50,000; who, without any practical knowledge of raising trees,
reeling and manufacturing silk, or having seen a silk-worm or
reel until he introduced them in 1843, has now presented me
with beautiful samples of <i>floss cocoons, reeled and sewing silk</i>,
done by ladies as a diversion, without any assistance, and very
little instruction from him. The silk is of good quality. Samples
had been sent by a mercantile house in Lima to England,
for an opinion of the quality; but no return had been received
when he came away. He has come to this place with a native
Spaniard, to obtain more perfect information in all the branches
of reeling, twisting, coloring(!), &amp;c.; to procure machinery,
with a view of enlarging operations, so that he might turn off
twenty-five pounds per day of sewings, cords, braids, &amp;c. He
represents the climate and soil as adapted to the culture of silk,
and could feed every month in the year; that the necessaries
of living are procured with but little labor; that the laboring
population are indolent, <i>the wealthy classes too proud to labor</i>.
He feels confident of success, and that he can introduce habits
of industry by silk culture, that would counteract their natural
indolence; and he will inform me of his success in due time,
that may be more interesting than speculations upon what he
intends doing. He has engaged several to perfect themselves in
reeling, &amp;c., to accompany him when he returns to Lima with
his machinery. He has become so satisfied with the superiority
of the genuine Canton mulberry, that he has engaged to take
it on with him for propagation and use.</p>

<p>“I have letters from widely different locations, rendering favorable
accounts of this year’s success in growing silk, and in
corroboration of the prevalent opinion <i>that the silk cause will
finally prevail</i>. I have several letters on this subject&mdash;one
from a gentleman presiding over one of our most eminent literary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
institutions, under date of June, 1844. Discoursing about
the culture of silk, he writes as follows:</p>

<p>“‘If this earnest waking up to a scientific and practical consideration
of the subject be not soon crowned with signal success,
it will not be for want of enterprize or skill in our countrymen,
but merely from the high price of labor here, compared
with the scanty wages given in other silk-growing countries.
Even this consideration, though it may <i>retard</i> for a while the
complete success of this department of productive industry, will
not prevent its ultimate <i>triumph</i>.’</p>

<p>“Another gentleman, under date of August, 1844, writes
from the far West, ‘that the soil and climate of the Western
and South-western States are admirably suited to the growth
of the mulberry and raising silk-worms,’ and that ‘eventually
the two great staples of the Western and South-western States
will be <i>silk</i> and <i>wool</i>.’ It is the opinion of competent skilful
silk manufacturers, who have made critical experiments upon
the <i>Pongee-silk</i> (so called) of foreign make, by tests which they
consider satisfactory and decisive, that it is <i>only a vegetable
production</i>, and that the material was never operated upon <i>by
the silk-worm</i>(?). There can be no reasonable doubt about the
ultimate success of silk-culture in some <i>future</i> years; but to
accelerate that desirable event, which may constitute an important
American staple for revenue (which might not only enrich
the Government, but reward the labor of personal enterprize),
a bounty is deemed necessary to stimulate and encourage that
portion of the agricultural population whose circumstances or
health disqualifies them for the more laborious exercises of the
fields, to commence operations upon a new and untried crop.
Our extensive imports of raw and manufactured silks are encouraged
by us as consumers, instead of being producers. We
now contribute to support foreign enterprize and industry, to
produce the article of silk, which we might, with proper encouragement,
raise ourselves, not only for our own consumption, but
for exportation.”</p>

Abdollatiph who visited Egypt A. D. 1200, informs us (Chapter iv. p. 188 of
Silvestre de Sacy’s French translation, p. 221 of Wahl’s German translation.),
“<i>that the cloth, rags, &amp;c. found in the catacombs, and used to envelope the
mummies, was made into garments, or sold to the scribes to make paper for
shop-keepers</i>.” This cloth is proved to be linen (See <a href="#Page_365">Part IV. p. 365</a>), and the
passage of Abdollatiph may be considered as decisive proof, which however has
never been produced as such, of the manufacture of linen paper as early as the
year 1200. Professor Tychsen in his learned and curious dissertation on the use
of paper from Papyrus (published in the <i>Commentationes Reg. Soc. Gottingensis
Recentiores</i>, vol. iv. A. D. 1820), has brought abundant testimonies to prove that
<i>Egypt supplied all Europe with this kind of paper until towards the end of the
eleventh century</i>. The use of it was then abandoned, cotton paper being employed
instead. The Arabs in consequence of their conquests in Bucharia, had
learnt the art of making <i>cotton paper</i> about the year 704, and through them or
the Saracens it was introduced into Europe in the <i>eleventh century</i>. Another
fact should not be lost sight of, namely, “that most of the old MSS. in Arabic
and other oriental languages are written on this sort of paper,” and that it was
first introduced into Europe by the Saracens of Spain. (For further proof, see

The amount of silk imported into the United States annually,
nearly equals that of linen and woollen together, and is
equal to one half of all other fabrics combined. Is it not then,
an important consideration, that this expenditure be saved to

    <div class="verse indent0">To him was grandeur; not the reposing sound</div>

<p>The inquiry into the origin and propagation of sheep, no less
than of the silk-worm, may be justly regarded as a subject of
the deepest interest. For the management and use of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
animals has, from the earliest dawn of human history, formed
a striking feature in the condition of man. Of the materials
employed by the ancients for making cloth, by far the most important
was the wool of sheep. We are able to trace with great
probability the process of sheep-breeding and of the use of wool
for weaving. Among the bones of quadrupeds, found in ancient
caves <i>throughout Europe</i>, we cannot find on consulting
the works of Cuvier, Buckland, and De la Beche, that remains
of sheep have ever been discovered. This fact affords some
reason for presuming, that the sheep is not a native of Europe,
but has been introduced there by man.</p>

<p>It appears to have been a general opinion among Zoologists,
that the Argali, or <i>Ovis Ammon</i> of Linnæus, which inhabits
in vast numbers the elevated regions of Central Asia, is the
primitive stock of the whole race of domesticated sheep. Agreeably
to this supposition we find, that from the earliest times the
inhabitants of Tartary, Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine,
and the North of Arabia, have been addicted to pastoral employments.
The tribes of wandering shepherds, which frequent
those countries, are descended from progenitors, who led
the same life thousands of years ago, and whose manners and
habits are preserved to the present day with scarcely the slightest
change.</p>

<p>As might be expected, we have little precise information respecting
the Scythians, who inhabited the elevated plains of
inner Asia. Some of their hordes are distinguished by Herodotus,
Strabo, and others, under the name of <i>Nomadic</i> or <i>pastoral</i>
Scythians; and that this denomination was understood
to imply, that they tended sheep as well as larger cattle may
be inferred from what Herodotus says of their use of felt (See
<a href="#Appendix_B">Appendix B</a>.). Strabo, moreover, says of a particular tribe of
the Massagetæ, that they had “few sheep,” which implies that
the rest were rich in flocks; and of another tribe he says,
“They do not till the ground, but derive their sustenance from
sheep and fish, <i>after the manner of the Nomadic Scythians</i><a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.”
But a much more distinct account of the manners of this people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
is given us by Justin, who says, that they were accustomed to
wander through uncultivated solitudes, always employed in
tending herds and flocks (<i>armenta et pecora</i>). He, however,
adds, that they were strangers to the use of woollen garments,
being clothed in skins and furs<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. Hence it appears, that they
were too rude and ignorant to have acquired the arts of <i>spinning</i>
and <i>weaving</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>If we may trust to the authority of Strabo, the Medes did
not tend sheep; for he says of them, “They eat the flesh of
wild animals; they do not bring up tame cattle<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.” Nevertheless,
their southern neighbors, the Persians, with whom they
were united under one government, had sheep in abundance.
These animals are strikingly represented in the bas-reliefs of
Persepolis. In one of them, which represents a long procession
sculptured on the wall of a splendid staircase, two rams,
attended by keepers, are accompanied in the same train by
horses, asses, camels, and oxen<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. Herodotus, in his account of
the manners and institutions of the Persians (L. i. cap. 133.),
mentions all these animals together in the following passage:
“Of all days they are accustomed to observe most that on
which each individual was born. On this day they set before
their guests a more abundant feast than on any other. The
wealthy provide an ox, a horse, a camel, and an ass, roasted
whole in furnaces; and the poor provide the smaller cattle.”
By “<i>the smaller cattle</i>,” this author always means sheep and
goats.</p>

<p>The superior excellence of the rich plains of Mesopotamia for
the pasture of sheep as well as oxen, is attested by Dionysius
Periegetes<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>, and his account illustrates in an interesting manner
the history of Jacob as contained in the book of Genesis,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
the rapid multiplication of the flocks and herds showing how
well the soil and climate were adapted to this pursuit, and how
well the business of tending them was there understood from
the earliest times. Seldom do we find in any ancient author
so beautiful a picture as is presented to us, when Jacob arrives
at Padan-aram, and sees the flocks of sheep and goats assembling
from the neighboring pastures in the evening to be watered
at the well. Rachel appears conducting the flock of her
father Laban, which she tended, and Jacob rolls from the
mouth of the well the stone, which was placed to preserve the
water cool and fresh, and assists his relative and future bride
in watering her sheep. (Gen. xxix. 1-10.) Also on Jacob’s
departure his remonstrance with Laban presents to us an animated
representation of the duties and difficulties of the shepherd’s
life; “These twenty years have I been with thee; thy
ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the
rams of thy flock have I not eaten. That which was torn of
beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it: of my
hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by
night. Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me,
and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine
eyes.” (Gen. xxxi. 38-40.)</p>

<p>From Ezekiel we learn, that Damascus supplied the Tyrians
with wool<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>, and Jerome, who well knew the country, says in
his comment on the passage, that this article was still produced
there in his time (A. D. 378.)<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. Aristotle, referring to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
sheep of Syria, mentions a variety with tails, which were a
cubit broad<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>; and Pliny in addition to this circumstance asserts
generally the abundance of the Syrian wool<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>. Probably the
part of Syria appropriated more especially to the breeding of
sheep, was the eastern part, which bordered on Arabia, and
was distinguished by the same natural features.</p>

<p>In no part of the ancient world does sheep-breeding appear
to have been more cultivated than in that which we are now
approaching. Here were the Moabites, among whom it was <i>a
royal occupation</i>, and, as it appears, the chief source of the
revenues of the sovereign: for it is said in 2 Kings iii. 4.
“Mesha, king of Moab, was <i>a sheep-master</i>, and rendered unto
the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred
thousand rams with the wool.” Here on occasion of a
war, which the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of
Manasseh, whose territory was to the east of Jordan, carried on
against the Hagarites, they obtained as part of their booty
250,000 sheep. (I. Chron. v. 21.) Here was Idumæa, in a
part of which Job is represented to have dwelt, being possessed
of 7,000, and afterwards of 14,000 sheep (Job i. 3. xlii. 12.):
and we have a beautiful allusion to the pastoral habits of the
same country in the language of consolation employed by the
prophet Micah (ii. 12.): “I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all
of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will
put them together as the sheep of Bosrah, as the flock in
the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by
reason of the multitude of men.” Here also were the Midianites,
whose flocks were so vast, that the sheep taken from them
by Moses after his victory amounted to 675,000. (Num.
xxxi. 32.) Jethro, the priest of Midian, was himself the owner
of a numerous flock, tended by his seven daughters, whom
Moses assisted in watering them, when the neighboring shepherds
rudely attempted to drive them from the well. He afterwards
married one of them, and was employed by the father as
his shepherd; and, having occasion according to the practice of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
the country to conduct the flock from the plains to pasture upon
the mountains of Horeb, he was thence called to undertake his
extraordinary mission for the deliverance of his nation. (Exod.
ii. 15-iii. 1.)</p>

<p>The Arabs appear from the earliest times to the present day
to have bestowed no less attention upon sheep than upon
horses. Isaiah also records the excellence of the sheep of Arabia
in the following terms addressed by the Almighty to his
people (Ch. lx. 7.): “All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered
together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto
thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I
will glorify the house of my glory.” The habits of the Nebatæi,
or Arabs of Nebaioth, are depicted as follows by Diodorus
Siculus: “They live in the open air, and call a land their
country, which is destitute of habitations, and has neither rivers
nor copious fountains, such as could satisfy an army of invaders.
<i>Their law forbids them on pain of death either to sow
corn, to plant fruit-trees, to use wine, or to build houses.</i>
They submit to this law, because they think, that those who
enjoy such conveniences may for the sake of them be readily
compelled by the powerful to do what they command. Some
of them rear camels, and others sheep, which they pasture in
the wilderness<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.”</p>

<p>Strabo (l. xvi. cap. 4. p. 460. ed. Siebenkees.), speaking apparently of another
division of the Nebatæi, says they have large oxen, camels, and white sheep.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Various ancient authors mention that extraordinary variety
of sheep among the Arabs, the tail of which grew to so great a
size as to require to be supported on a wooden carriage, which
was dragged after the wearer<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.</p>

<p>We have no reason to believe, that the Phœnicians employed
themselves in the breeding and pasture of sheep. The narrow
strip of territory, which they occupied at the eastern extremity
of the Mediterranean Sea, was in general too densely peopled
to be adapted for this purpose. Their activity, intelligence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
and enterprize were directed into other channels, and they supplied
themselves from foreign countries with wool for their celebrated
manufactures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Hebrews, who were the immediate
neighbors of the Phœnicians, were altogether an agricultural and
pastoral people. The history of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, presents to us beautiful images of the kind of life,
which still continues with little variation among the Bedouins,
or wandering Nomads of Arabia. Not only was David <i>a
shepherd boy</i>; but, when he had ascended the throne, he had
numerous herds and flocks superintended by distinct officers.
“And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite:
and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat
the son of Adlai. Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite:
and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:
and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagarite. All these were
the rulers of the substance which was king David’s.” (I.
Chron. xxvii. 29-31.) The reader cannot fail to call to mind
David’s frequent allusions in the Psalms to those employments,
which were no less familiar to his own mind than to the rest
of his countrymen, and which supplied to them the most touching
comparisons for the expression of their deepest religious
convictions. The passage “The Lord is my shepherd: I shall
not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he
leadeth me beside the still waters. Yea though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou
art with me; thy rod (or <i>crook</i>) and thy staff, they comfort
me” (Psalm xxiii. 1, 2, 4.). “He shall feed (<i>i. e.</i> <i>tend</i>) his
flock like a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs with his arm,
and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that
are with young” (Is. xl. ii.). “The pastures are <i>clothed</i> with
flocks,” an expression denoting the vast multitudes of sheep,
which overspread the mountains and plains (Ps. lxv. 13.).
“Be thou diligent,” says Solomon, “to know the state of thy
flocks, and look well to thy herds. The lambs are for thy
clothing, and the goats are the price of thy field; and thou
shalt have goat’s milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy
household, and for the maintenance of thy maidens” (Prov.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
xxvii. 23. 26, 27.). We would particularly refer the reader to
the thirty-fourth chapter of Ezekiel, where the prophet, reprimanding
the rulers of Israel under the character of shepherds,
makes some allusion to every circumstance connected with the
care of sheep and goats. Language very similar is employed
by our Saviour in John x. where he speaks of himself as “<i>the
good shepherd</i>.” The whole system and history of the sacrifices
both before and after the giving of the Mosaic law, might
be produced to prove the pastoral habits of this people from the
earliest times. The districts of Bashan and Carmel, seem to
have attained the highest reputation in respect to the breeding
of sheep. Bashan, which lay to the east of the Jordan in the
country adjoining that of the Hagarites and Moabites, already
mentioned, and Carmel, the mountainous range near the Dead
Sea in the south of Judea. In the latter district Nabal kept
his flocks, and as he is said to have been “very great,” and we
are at the same time informed that “he had 3000 sheep and
1000 goats” (I. Sam. xxv. 2.), these numbers afford us a precise
idea of the wealth of a considerable proprietor in this respect.
That the “rams of the breed of Bashan,” were particularly
celebrated, we learn from Deut. xxxii. 14; and Ezekiel
mentions with distinction (ch. xxxix. 18.) a sacrifice “of rams,
of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of
Bashan.”</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive a more striking difference in
manners and institutions, than that which must have presented
itself to the traveller in very ancient times, when on crossing the
Isthmus of Suez he passed from the deserts of Arabia and Idumæa
to the richly cultivated and populous plains of Egypt. According
to the statement already quoted from an ancient historian the
wandering tribes of Nabaioth were forbidden by a positive law
to till the ground or to construct settled habitations, and they
lived on the produce of their flocks, which they continually led
from place to place in pursuit of pasture adapted to the season of
the year. The Egyptians, on the contrary, appear to have
been originally under a prohibition of exactly the opposite kind,
since they cultivated the ground with care, excelled most other
nations in all the arts of life, and produced the most splendid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
proofs of their architectural skill, but were not allowed to keep
flocks of sheep and goats. That this was the case at the time,
when Jacob took his family to sojourn in Egypt, is evident from
their application to Pharaoh on arriving in the land of Goshen,
which was on the eastern border of Egypt adjoining Palestine
and Arabia, to be permitted to remain there on the ground, that
from their youth they had been accustomed to tend flocks,
whereas “every shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>
</div>

<p>It appears that the Nabatæan law was far more effectual
towards the attainment of its object than the Egyptian. For,
whereas the pastoral tribes of Arabia have retained their independence
and their national peculiarities even to the present
day; the Egyptians, on the other hand, became a prey to foreign
invasion, and among other changes in their customs we
have to notice the introduction of the management of sheep.
Even as early as the time of Moses the practice had commenced;
for in the account of the effects of the murrain in Exodus
ix. 3, we find mention of sheep, and indeed it is remarkable,
that the domestic animals there enumerated, viz. horses, asses,
camels, oxen, and sheep, are exactly the same, which, as we
have before shown, were bred by the ancient Persians<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. Later
historians afford distinct testimony to the same fact. Thus
Diodorus Siculus says, that “upon the subsidence of the waters
after the inundation of the Nile the flocks were admitted to
pasture, and the produce of the soil was so abundant, that the
sheep were not only shorn <i>twice</i>, but also brought forth young
<i>twice</i> in the year.” Herodotus also plainly supposes, that sheep
and goats were bred in Egypt, when he contrasts the inhabitants
of the Theban Nome, who worshipped Ammon, with
the inhabitants of the Mendesian Nome, who worshipped
Mendes. The former, he says, “all abstain from sheep, and
sacrifice goats;” the latter “abstain from goats, which they
hold in veneration, and sacrifice sheep.” He, however, mentions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
that the Thebans slew a ram once a year on occasion of
a particular ceremony, which he describes (ii. 42. 46.). The
testimony of Strabo and Plutarch, though differing in some
particulars from that of Herodotus, is to the same general effect.
Aristotle (<i>l. c.</i>) mentions, that the sheep of Egypt were
larger than those of Greece.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_239" href="#FNanchor_239" class="label">[239]</a> It should be observed, that the Hebrew word translated <i>sheep</i> in Ex. ix. 3.
included goats.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But, although these passages show, that sheep were bred in
Egypt, we think it evident that their number was very limited.
Egyptian wool cannot have been of the least importance as an
article of commerce. What was produced must also have been
consumed in the country. For, although the chief material for
the clothing of the Egyptians was linen, and they were forbidden
to be buried in woollen or to use it in the temples, yet Herodotus
(ii. 81.) states, that on ordinary occasions they wore a
garment of white wool over their linen shirt. They also used
wool for embroidering. According to Pliny<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> the Egyptian wool
was coarse and of a short staple. Tertullian records a saying
of the Egyptians, that Mercury invented the spinning of wool
in their country<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Strabo in an instructive manner contrasts the Ethiopians with
the Egyptians. Having observed, that the boundary between
the two nations was the smaller cataract above Syene and
Elephantine, he says, that the Ethiopians led for the most part
a pastoral life without resources, both on account of their intemperate
climate and the poverty of their soil, and also because
they were remote from the civilized world; whereas the Egyptians
had always lived in a refined manner and under a regular
government, settled in fixed habitations, and cultivating
philosophy, agriculture, and the arts<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>. Thus do we find the
nomad life recurring immediately to the south of Egypt. Strabo
further states, that the Ethiopian sheep were small, and instead
of being woolly were hairy like goats, on which account
the people wore skins instead of woollen cloth<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>. That these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
sheep were held in some estimation by the Egyptians is, however,
manifest from the fact, that in the splendid procession exhibited
at Alexandria by Ptolemy Philadelphus, there were 130
sheep from Ethiopia, 300 from Arabia, and 20 from Eubœa
<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.
Also, that the pastoral habits of the Ethiopians were known to
the Romans may be inferred from the allusion, which Virgil
makes to them in his Tenth Eclogue (l. 64-68.):</p>

<p>We find, that the people of Libya had attained to some distinction
in the management of flocks. What Diodorus says of
the Egyptian sheep is asserted by Aristotle of those of Libya,
viz. that they produced young <i>twice</i> in the year<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. That sheep-breeding
had extended hither in very early times appears from
a passage in the Odyssey, which, however, in consequence of
the remoteness of the situation and the imperfect knowledge of
geography in the time of the writer, is mixed with fable, inasmuch
as it represents, that the ewes brought forth not only
twice, but even <i>three</i> times in the year, and that the lambs
were immediately provided with horns<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that, although the Libyan shepherd according
to Virgil’s description led a migratory life, conducting
his sheep from place to place in search of pasture, yet the scale,
upon which he carried on his operations, was widely different
from that which has always characterized the nomadic tribes
of Asia. The poet represents the Libyan shepherd as a solitary
wanderer, bearing with him all his arms and implements,
just as a Roman soldier (l. 346.) carried his military accoutrements.
On the other hand, as we have seen, the Syrian or
Arabian shepherd goes in a kind of state, with camels and
horses to carry his wife and children, his tents, and the rest of
his equipage; and he is followed by thousands, instead of hundreds
or perhaps scores, of sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Let us now pursue the progress of this employment in another
direction, viz. towards the north-west, and across the Euxine
Sea and the straits connected with it into Europe.</p>

<p>Near the eastern extremity of the Euxine Sea we meet with
a very remarkable instance of the attention paid to the produce
and manufacture of wool in a tribe called <i>the Coraxi</i>. Strabo
alludes to the value of their fleeces in a passage which we shall
produce in speaking of the wool of Spain, to which it more directly
refers. At present we shall only consider the following
evidence preserved by Joannes Tzetzes.</p>

<p>Hipponax, who is here cited by Tzetzes, was a satirical poet
of Ephesus, and flourished about 540 B. C. In confirmation
of his testimony it may be proved, that his countrymen and
contemporaries had constant intercourse with a port in the
vicinity of the Coraxi. We learn from Pliny (l. vi. cap. 5.)<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>,
that the Coraxi were situated near Dioscurias, which, though
deserted in his time, had been formerly so illustrious that 300
nations, <i>speaking different languages</i>, resorted to it. As we
learn from other authorities, Dioscurias <i>was a colony of Miletus
and one of its chief settlements</i>. Miletus also in the time of
Hipponax had risen to the summit of its prosperity, and was the
greatest commercial city in the world next to Tyre and Carthage<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.
Its chief trade was towards the north and as far as the
extremity of the Euxine Sea. Among the numerous Asiatic
tribes, which were accustomed to bring their productions to Dioscurias
and exchange them for Grecian merchandise, the Coraxi
were, as we may conclude from the evidence now produced, a
nation of superior enterprize and intelligence, who sent to the
shores of the Ægean in the vessels of Miletus their fine wool,
as well as the <i>carpets</i> and <i>shawls</i>, which they made from it.</p>

<p>If we had no more exact information than that which has
been already cited, we might infer, that the Coraxi occupied
part of the modern Circassia, a mountainous region admirably
adapted to the breeding of sheep. The Circassians of the present
day have numerous herds of cattle and vast flocks of sheep
and goats. Their vallies are distinguished by beauty and fertility.
A late traveller says, that from whatever country you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
enter Circassia, “<i>you are at once agreeably impressed with
the decided improvement in the appearance of the population,
the agriculture, and the beauty of their flocks and
herds</i><a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.” With respect to Dioscurias, we are informed, that
“the memory of its ancient name is still preserved in the present
appellation of Iskouriah<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.” Sir John Chardin, who visited
it and calls it Isgaour, commends its safety in summer as a road
for ships, but says that it is a complete desert, where he could
obtain no provisions, the traders who anchor there being obliged
to construct temporary huts and booths of the boughs of trees
for their accommodation, whilst awaiting the arrival of the natives
of Mingrelia and Caucasus<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.</p>

Julius von Klaproth, in the work quoted below, says, (p. 582.), that the wealth
of the Circassians consists principally in their sheep, from whose wool the women
make coarse cloth and felt. In the summer they drive their sheep into the mountains,
but feed them under cover in winter, and at other times in the plains.</p>

<p>But, besides the general inference that the Coraxi occupied
part of the modern Circassia, we are able to determine their
abode with still greater precision, and even obtain some insight
into their distinctive characters as a nation.</p>

<p>At the south-eastern extremity of Chirkess, or Circassia, on
the northern declivity of Mount Elborus, and about the sources
of the Kuban, the ancient Hypanis, we find a mountain clan,
consisting of rather more than 250 families, which appears to
retain not only the manners and habits, but even the very
name of the Coraxi. Julius von Klaproth, to whom we are
principally indebted for our knowledge of them, calls them the
Caratshai<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. From him we learn the following particulars respecting
their appearance, manners, and employments. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
are among the most beautiful of the inhabitants of Caucasus,
and more like the Georgians than the wandering Tartars of
the Steppe. <i>They are well formed, and have fine features,
which are set off by large black eyes and a white skin.</i>
Their language resembles that of the Nogay-Tartars. They
live in very neat houses, built of pine. Their children are
<i>strictly</i> and <i>well</i> educated; and in general it may be said of
them, that they are the most cultivated nation in Caucasus,
surpassing all their neighbors in refinement of manners. They
are very <i>industrious</i>, and subsist chiefly by agriculture. Their
soil is productive, and, besides various kinds of grain, yields
abundance of grass for pasture. The country around them is
covered with woods, which abound with wild animals, such as
bears, wolves, wild goats, hares, and wild cats, whose skins are
much prized, and martins. <i>Their dress is chiefly made of
woollen cloth, which they weave themselves from the produce
of their flocks, and which is admired throughout the whole
of Caucasus. They sell their cloth</i>, called by them <i>Shal</i><a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>,
their <i>felt</i> for <i>carpeting</i>, and their furs, partly to the Nogay-Tartars
and Circassians, from whom they purchase articles of
metal, and partly <i>at Souchom-Kalé, a Turkish fort on the
Black Sea</i>, which contains shops and ware-houses, and carries
on a considerable trade with the Western Caucasus. They receive
here in return goods of <i>cotton</i> and <i>silk</i>, tobacco and tobacco-pipes,
needles, thimbles, and otter-skins. While the men
are employed out of doors, the women stay at home, make
gold and silver thread, and sew the clothes of their fathers and
brothers.</p>

We cannot survey the now deserted Iscuria without observing,
what a mournful contrast the Euxine presents under the
sway of both Russia and Turkey to the useful energy, which
more than 2000 years ago promoted life and the arts of life,
and brought into close and peaceful contact the most refined
and the most uncultivated nations, under the direction of the
Ionians of Miletus. The beauty, the bravery, the activity,
and the independence of a highland clan still represent the skill
and enterprize of the ancient Coraxi; but the commerce,
which rewarded their industry, and extended their reputation
through the civilized world, has sunk into insignificance.</p>

<p>Besides the above notices of the Coraxi in Strabo and Tzetzes
we find little said concerning the breeding of sheep in this
part of Asia. Aristotle, however, mentions the sheep of “Pontus
near Scythia,” and says that they were without horns<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.
The Melanchlæni also, who are mentioned by Herodotus in his
account of the Scythian tribes, and who lived to the north of
the Coraxi, were so called, because they wore black palls.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, that the use and management of
sheep were known from the earliest times throughout nearly
the whole of Asia Minor, and that some nations in this region
had attained to a superiority in the art before the settlement in
it of the Grecian colonists.</p>

<p>The imagery of the Homeric poems (supposed to be written
about 900 B. C.) affords abundant evidence of these facts.
They continually mention shepherds, who had the care of
sheep, as well as goat-herds, who managed goats. They speak
of the folds, in which the flocks were secured at night to preserve
them from the attacks of wild beasts. The dangers to
which the flocks were exposed from both wolves and lions, are
in accordance with similar expressions and incidents in the
Scriptures of the Old Testament, arising from the existence of
the same ravenous and destructive quadrupeds in Palestine.
Also, the language both of the Scriptures and of the Homeric
poems <i>is precisely the same</i>, in which the king, ruling his people
is compared to the shepherd tending his flock, or to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
strong and large ram, which leads the sheep<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. It is to be observed,
that the geographical knowledge expressed in the Homeric
poems extended as far as the promontory of Carambis
on the south coast of the Euxine Sea, and included all Phrygia,
Ionia, and the western half of Asia Minor.</p>

</div>

<p>The Greek mythology affords similar evidence. The well-known
story of Paris, adjudging the golden apple, is founded on
the pastoral scenes of Ida. Marsyas also was a shepherd on
mount Ida<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>: the river Marsyas, famed for his contest with
Apollo, was among the Phrygian mountains<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_260" href="#FNanchor_260" class="label">[260]</a> It appears not impossible, that, when Theocritus in Idyll. iii. 46, represents
Adonis as “tending flocks upon the mountains,” he may have referred to the
mountains of Phrygia or of Ionia. For in another Idyll. (i. 105-110,) he seems
to connect the love of Venus for Adonis with her love for Anchises, as if the
scene of both were in the same region. Among the various accounts of Adonis,
one makes him the offspring of Smyrna; and Cinyras, <i>the father of Adonis, is
said to have founded the city of Smyrna in Ionia, calling it by that name after
his daughter</i>. (Hyginus, Fab. 58 and 275.) This supposition accounts most
satisfactorily for the production of the beautiful elegy on the death of Adonis by
Bion, who was a native of Smyrna.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The historical evidence to which we now proceed, though referring
to times much posterior to the mythological, is more exact
as well as more entitled to absolute credit.</p>

<p>According to Strabo the branches of Mount Taurus in
<i>Pisidia</i> were rich in pastures “for all kinds of cattle<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.” The
chief town of this region was <i>Selge</i>, a very flourishing city,
and hence Tertullian, in a passage, mentions “oves Selgicæ,”
Selgic sheep, among those of the greatest celebrity. The superior
whiteness of the fleeces of <i>Pamphylia</i> is mentioned by
Philostratus.</p>

<p>We have reason to believe, that the <i>Lydians</i> and <i>Carians</i>
bestowed the greatest attention on sheep-breeding and on the
woollen manufacture before the arrival of the Greek colonists
among them. The new settlers adopted the employments of
the ancient inhabitants, and made those employments subservient
to a very extensive and lucrative trade. Pliny (viii. 73.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
ed. Bip.) mentions the wool of Laodicea (See <a href="#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>.) in
Caria; and Strabo (xii. c. 7. p. 578. Casaub.) observes, that
the country about this city and Colossæ, which was not far from
it, produced sheep highly valued on account of the fineness and
the color of their fleeces.</p>

<p>Aristophanes mentions a <i>pall</i>, made of “Phrygian fleeces<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>:”
and Varro asserts, that in his time there were many flocks of
wild sheep in Phrygia<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>.</p>

<p>The passages above quoted from Strabo and Joannes Tzetzes
allude to the very great celebrity of the wool of <i>Miletus</i> and
of the articles woven from it.</p>

<p>The passages, which will now be produced from both Greek
and Latin authors of various ages, conspire to prove the distinguished
excellence of the wool of Miletus, although in many
of them the epithet <i>Milesian</i> may be employed only in a proverbial
acceptation to denote wool of the finest quality. The
animals, which yielded this wool, must have been bred in the
interior of Ionia not far from Miletus.</p>

<p>Ctesias describes the softness of camels’-hair by comparing it
to Milesian fleeces<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. A woman in Aristophanes (Lysist. 732.)
says, she must go home to spread her Milesian fleeces on the
couch, because the worms were gnawing them. In a fragment
of a Greek comedy, called Procris, of a somewhat later age
(ap. Athen. l. xii. p. 553), a favorite lap-dog is described, lying
on Milesian fleeces:</p>

<p>We may now notice Samos, as being near the Ionic coast.
Athenæus (xii. p. 540. D.) cites two ancient authors who assert
that, when Polycrates was introducing into Samos the most excellent
of the different breeds of animals, he chose the dogs of
Laconia and Molossis, the goats of Scyros and Naxos, and the
sheep of Miletus and Attica.</p>

<p>Respecting the breeding of sheep in <i>Samos</i> it may be proper
to quote the remark of Ælian (Hist. Anim. xii. 40.), that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
Samians gave some religious honor to this animal, because a
consecrated utensil of gold, which had been stolen from one of
their temples, was discovered by a sheep.</p>

<p>It appears probable, that the shepherd life was established in
Thrace as early as in any part of Europe; for in the Homeric
poems it is called “the mother of flocks” (Il. v. 222.). In a
much later age the sheep of Thrace are mentioned by Nicander
(Nicand. Ther. 50.). We learn from Plato (De Legibus, l. vii.
p. 36. ed. Bekker) that in Thrace the flocks were entrusted to
the care of the women, who were there compelled like slaves to
work out of doors.</p>

<p>Aristotle speaks of the sheep of Magnesia, and says that
they brought forth young twice a year<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.</p>

<p>A little further south we find sheep from the earliest times in
Thessaly near the river Amphrysus. Here was Iton, which
Homer also calls “the mother of flocks<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.” It was celebrated
for a temple of Minerva, who was called from it <i>Itonis</i>, or
<i>Itonia</i><a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>, and whose worship was transferred from hence to
Bœotia.</p>

<p>That Eubœa was famous for sheep we know from the testimony

<p>Bœotia appears from very early times to have been rich in
flocks. The tragic history of Œdipus supposes, that his father
Laius, the king of Thebes, had flocks on Mount Cithæron. According
to Sophocles (Œd. Tyr. 1026-1140.) Œdipus was delivered
to one of the royal shepherds to be there exposed, and this
shepherd through pity committed him to another, and thus saved
his life<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. Seneca in his free version of Sophocles (Œd. Act. iv.
v. 815-850.) has added a circumstance, as it appears, from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
practice established in other cases. He says, that the shepherd
of Laius, whom he calls <i>Phorbas</i>, had many others under him.
But, although it may be doubted whether the flocks of Laius were
so numerous as to require a head shepherd placed over many
others, we learn that his possessions of this description excited
contest and warfare among his descendants. Their countryman,
Hesiod, represents them fighting at the gates of Thebes
“for the flocks of Œdipus” (Op. et Dies, 163.), an expression,
which must at least be understood to imply, that sheep constituted
a principal part of the king’s wealth.</p>

<p>Among the Elgin marbles in the British Museum we have an
interesting inscription relating to a contract made between the
city of Orchomenos in Bœotia and Eubulus of Elatea in Phocis,
<i>according to which Eubulus was to have for four years the
right of pasturage for 4 cows, 200 mares, 20 sheep, and
1000 goats</i>. In the opinion of Professors Böckh<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and Ottfried
Müller<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> this inscription may be referred to the time of the Peloponnesian
war. The supposed effect of the waters of the
Melas and Cephisos on the fleeces of sheep is a testimony of a
much later date, but proves that sheep, both black and white,
were bred in that country<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>. Varro (De Re Rust. ii. 2.) mentions
the practice of covering sheep with skins in order to improve
and preserve their fleeces. The Attic sheep, thus clothed with
skins, are mentioned by Demosthenes under the name of “soft
sheep<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>.” The hilly part of Attica was of course particularly
adapted for sheep as well as goats; and accordingly a letter of
Alciphron (iii. 41.) describes flocks of them at Decelia near
Mount Parnes about fifteen miles to the north of Athens. The
fame of the Attic wool is also alluded to by Plutarch (De audiendo,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>

<p>In the Peloponnesus, <i>Arcadia</i> was always remarkable for
the attention paid to sheep.</p>

<p>Arcadia claims our especial consideration, because in it the
shepherd life assumed that peculiar form, which has been the
subject of so much admiration both in ancient and modern
times. Here the lively genius and imaginative disposition
common to the Greek nation were directed to the daily contemplation
of the most beautiful and romantic varieties of mountain
and woodland scenery, and hence their employments, their
pleasures, and their religion, all acquired a rustic character,
highly picturesque and tasteful, and, as it appears to us, generally
favorable to the development of the domestic and social
virtues. To attempt a full investigation of this subject, and to
show in what degree the want of higher attainments <i>in religious
knowledge</i> and <i>moral cultivation</i> was supplied by the peculiar
rites, ideas, and customs of Arcadia, would lead us too
far from our proper subject. We only wish to bring forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
the principal facts and authorities, and to give a succint account
of the genuine Arcadian system of religion and manners
without attempting to refute at length the opposite views,
which have been adopted by ancient and modern writers.</p>

<p>The peculiar Divinity of Arcadia, whose worship had a constant
and manifest reference to the principal employments of
the inhabitants, was <i>Pan</i>. Hence he is called by Virgil and
Propertius “the God of Arcadia<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>.” According to Herodotus
(ii. 145.), Pan, the son of Mercury (who was born at Cyllene
in Arcadia, where Mercury was previously worshipped,) first
saw the light after the Trojan war, and about 800 years before
his own time. Thus we are able to refer the supposed birth of
Pan, and consequently the commencement of his worship to
about the year 1260 B. C.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The circumstances of the birth of this divinity, with his habits
and employments, are described as follows in the most ancient
document which we have relating to him, viz. Homer’s
Hymn to Pan. Mercury tended rough flocks at Cyllene in
the service of a mortal man, being enamored of a beautiful
nymph. In the course of time she bore him a son, <i>having the
feet of a goat, two horns upon his forehead, a long shaggy
beard, and a bewitching smile</i>. This was Pan, who became
the god of the shepherds, and the companion of the mountain
nymphs, penetrating through the densest thickets, and inhabiting
the most wild, rough, and lofty summits of the sylvan Arcadia.
There it is his business to destroy the wild beasts;
<i>and when, having returned from hunting, he drives his
sheep into a cave, he plays upon his reeds a tune sweet as
the song of any bird in spring</i>. The nymphs, delighting in
melody, listen to him when they go to the dark fountain, and
the god sometimes appears among them, wearing on his back
the hide of a <i>lynx</i>, which he has lately killed, and he joins with
them in the choral song and dance upon a meadow variegated
with the <i>crocus</i> and the <i>hyacinth</i>. He is beloved by Bacchus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
and is the delight of his father Mercury, and he celebrates their
worship beyond that of all the other gods.</p>

<p>Callimachus (Hymn. in Dianam, 88.) represents Pan at his
fold in Arcadia, feeding his dogs with the flesh of a lynx, which
he has caught on Mænalus. It is to be observed, that the care
of dogs to guard the flock was an indispensable part of the pastoral
office. Philostratus, in his Second Book of Pictures<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>, supposes
the nymphs to have been reproving Pan for his want of
grace in dancing, <i>telling him that he leapt too high and like
a goat</i>, and offering to teach him a more gentle method. He
pays no attention to them, but tries to catch hold of them.
Upon this they surprise him sleeping at noon after the toils of
the chase; and he is represented in the picture with his arms
tied behind him, and enraged and struggling against them,
while they are cutting off his beard and trying to transform
his legs and to humanize him.</p>

to Pan as the god of shepherds, the guardian of flocks,
and the inventor of the syrinx, or Pandean pipes.</p>

<p>Besides the four places in Arcadia, which are referred to in
the above-cited passages of Virgil, Pausanias informs us of several
others, in which he saw temples and altars erected to Pan.
He says<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>, that Mount Mænalus was especially sacred to this
deity, <i>so that those who dwelt in its vicinity asserted, that
they sometimes heard him playing on the syrinx</i>. A continual
fire burnt there near his temple.</p>

<p>Herodotus gives a very curious account of the introduction
of the worship of Pan into Attica<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>. He says, that before the
battle of Marathon the Athenian generals sent Philippides as
a herald to Sparta. “On his return Philippides asserted, that
Pan had appeared to him near Mount Parthenius above Tegea,
had addressed him by name and with a loud voice, and
commanded him to ask the Athenians why they did not pay
any regard to him, a god, who was kind to them, who had
been often useful to them and would be so in future. The
Athenians, believing the statement of Philippides, when they
found themselves prosperous, erected a temple to Pan below
the Acropolis, and continued to propitiate him by annual sacrifices
and by carrying the torch.” From various authorities we
know, that this temple was in the cave on the northern side of
the Acropolis below the Propylæa<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.</p>

<p>In Sir R. Worsley’s collection of Antiques at Appledurcombe in the Isle of

right. A train of worshippers are conducting a ram to the altar within the cave.
See Museum Worsleianum, Lon. 1794. plate 9. In the vestibule of the University
Library at Cambridge is a mutilated statue of Pan clothed in a goat-skin
and holding the syrinx in his left hand. This statue was discovered near the
same cave, and from its style, (the Æginetic,) may be supposed to have been
carved soon after the battle of Marathon. See Dr. E. D. Clarke s Greek Marbles,

<p>Chandler and Dodwell in their Travels describe another
cave larger than that at Marathon and containing more varied
stalagmitic concretions. It is near the summit of Mount Rapsāna
between Athens and Sunium. ΠΑΝΟϹ is inscribed on
the rock near the entrance, proving that it was considered
sacred to Pan. It is no doubt the Panīon mentioned by

by sacrificing a she-goat or lamb, by gifts of cakes or fruit, and by libations
of milk, oil, and honey; simply believing, that this attention was pleasing
to them, <i>that they were present though unseen</i>, and partook without diminishing
the offering; their appetites as well as passions, caprices, and employments resembling
the human. At noon-day the pipe was silent on the mountains, <i>lest it

<p>The Corycian cave on Mount Parnassus was dedicated by
the surrounding inhabitants to Pan and to the Nymphs<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>.
Theocritus also (Idyll. viii. v. 103.) speaks of Homole, a mountainous
tract in the south of Thessaly, as belonging to Pan.
Altars were dedicated to Pan on the race-course at Olympia in
Elis<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>, as we may presume, out of respect to the Arcadians, who
resorted to the Olympic games. Pindar states<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>, that he had
near his door a statue of Pan. Here, as his able commentators
Heyne and Böckh observe, his daughters with other Theban

<p>On a vase of Greek marble in the Royal Museum at Naples
(This vase was first described in [Italian 275] Bayardi, Catalogo degli antichi
monumenti dissottarretti da Ercolano. Napoli, 1754, p. 290.
No. 914.), we see Pan dancing with the nymphs exactly as he
is represented in the preceding song. The sculpture is in that
very ancient style, which is called <i>Etruscan</i>. Pan is here exhibited
with goats’ feet and horns (Hom. Hymn. in Pana, 1. 2.).
He wears the skin of an animal, and employs his right hand in
drawing it up towards his left shoulder. In his left hand he
holds the crook or pastoral staff, which is one of his usual emblems.
Pan and the three females, with whom he is dancing,
form a distinct group by themselves. They are moving round
a large stone, and the artist probably imagined them to be
moving first in one direction, and then in the opposite, as if
performing the Strophe and Antistrophe around an altar. We
learn from Mr. Dodwell, that the modern Greeks in their circular
dances hold each other with a handkerchief, and not by the
hand<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.</p>

<p>That the Romans considered Pān and Faun to be the same,
using the two names indiscriminately, the one as the Greek,
the other as the Latin form, is evident from such passages as
the following:</p>

<p>The names Pan and Faun, scarcely differ except in this,
that the one begins with P, the <i>lenis</i>, and the other with F,
which is its <i>aspirate</i>: in the second place, both were conceived
to have not only the same form and appearance, but the
same habits, dispositions, and employments: thirdly, the goat
was sacrificed to Pan in Greece<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and to Faunus in Italy<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>, because
the Arcadian and Roman deity was conceived to be the
guardian of goats as well as sheep, but this animal was not
sacrificed to the Egyptian Mendes, because</p>

<p>in Egypt the goat itself was supposed to be Mendes, an incarnation
of the god; and lastly, it is recorded as an historical fact,
that the worship of Faunus was brought to Rome from Arcadia,
whereas the supposition of the introduction of the same worship
into Arcadia from Egypt, though found in the pages of
an historian, is not given by him as a matter of history, but
only as a matter of opinion. The account of the origin of the
worship of Faunus at Rome, is as follows: <i>Evander, the Arcadian,
introduced a colony of his countrymen into Italy,
and established there the rights of Mercury and of the Lycean
Pan on the hill, which was afterwards called the Palatine
Mount and became part of the city of Rome</i>. A cave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
at the base of the hill was dedicated to Pan, as we have seen
was the case some centuries afterwards at Athens

<p>In the preceding observations we have endeavored to give a
correct representation of the real sentiments and practices of
the Arcadians in regard to the proper divinity of their country;
and from this account we are naturally led to inquire what influence
this peculiar belief and worship had upon their manners
and their social life. Whilst the elegant simplicity and innocence
of the Arcadian shepherds, their graceful chorusses, their
dance and song, their love for their fleecy charge, which they
delighted and soothed with the melody of the pipe, have been
the theme and ornament of poetry and romance from the earliest
times, the question is highly important and interesting,
whether these ideal visions are realised by historical testimony?
whether the shepherds of the ancient Arcadia were so entirely
and so favorably distinguished from men of the same class and
employment in almost all other times and countries? One
modern writer denies this fact. He says, “The refined and
almost spiritualized state of innocence, which we call the pastoral
life of Arcadia, was entirely unknown to the ancients:”
and he quotes in support of this assertion several expressions,
used by Philostratus and other writers, and denoting contempt
for the Arcadians as a rude, ignorant, stupid race of people<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.
Polybius, who was an Arcadian, confidently asserts, that they
had throughout Greece a high and honorable reputation, not
only on account of their hospitality to strangers and their benevolence
towards all men, but especially on account of their <i>piety
towards the divine being</i>! It is true they make no figure
in Grecian history, because they were too wise to take part in
the irrational contests, which continually embroiled the surrounding
states. Their division into small independent communities,
each presenting a purely <i>democratic</i> constitution,
<i>rendered it impossible for them to acquire celebrity in legislation</i>;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
and yet we are informed of some of the citizens of Arcadia,
who were reputed excellent lawgivers for the sphere in
which they acted<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>. It appears to be no inconsiderable evidence
of their progress in the art of government upon republican principles,
<i>that in the choice of magistrates at Mantinea they
proceeded upon the plan of a double election</i><a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>. We have
the most decisive proofs of their public spirit in the splendid
cities, which they erected, and which were adorned with theatres,
temples, and numerous other edifices. We are informed
by Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>, that of all the temples in Peloponnesus the most
beautiful and admirable were those of Minerva at Tegea and
of Apollo at Phigalia; and these were both cities of Arcadia.
Now it should be observed, that the taste and splendor of their
public edifices are the more decisive proofs of their national enthusiasm,
when it is considered, <i>that among them property
was exceedingly subdivided; that they had no overpowering
aristocracy</i>, no princes or great landed gentry, who might
seek for renown or court popularity by bestowing their wealth
upon public institutions; but that the noble temples, the sculptures,
and other works of art, which ornamented their cities
and were subservient to purposes of common interest, could
have been produced only by the united deliberations and contributions
of the mass of the inhabitants. They seem therefore
to <i>prove</i> the <i>universal</i> prevalence both of a liberal patriotic
feeling, and of a cultivated taste for the beautiful and the
sublime.</p>

<p>This must of course be understood as referring only to music
and poetry of the pastoral kind. To the composition of the
higher species of poetry, by which the Greeks of other countries
laid a foundation for the instruction and delight of all succeeding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
ages, the Arcadians never aspired. At the same time
there can be no doubt that they bestowed great care upon the
exhibition of dramatic compositions, though they did not attempt
to write them: of this fact we have sufficient proof in
the remains of the theatres found upon the sites of their principal
cities, and especially of the theatre of Megalopolis, which
was the greatest in all Greece<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p>But with respect to their cultivation of music and its influence
on their national character, we have upon record the full
and explicit testimony of one of their most distinguished citizens,
the historian Polybius, whose remarks will appear especially
deserving of the reader’s attention, when it is considered,
that he must himself have gone through the whole course of
discipline and instruction which he describes. Having had occasion
to mention the turbulent character as well as the cruel
and perfidious conduct of the Cynætheans, who occupied a city
and district in the north of Arcadia, he proposes to inquire why
it was that, although they were indeed Arcadians, they had
acted in a manner so entirely at variance with the usual habits
and manners of the Greeks, and he then proceeds with earnestness
and solemnity to explain upon the following principles the
cause of this extraordinary contrast. It was, as he states, that
the Cynætheans were the only inhabitants of Arcadia who had
neglected to exercise themselves in music; and he then gives
the following account of the established practice of the rest of
the Arcadians in devoting themselves to the study of <i>real</i>
music, by which he means the united arts of music, poetry, and
dancing, of all those elegant and graceful performances, over
which the Muses were supposed to preside. He informs us
that the Arcadians, whose general habits were very severe,
were required by law to go on improving themselves in music,
so understood, until their thirtieth year. “In childhood,” says
he, “they are taught to sing in tune hymns and pæans in
honor of the domestic heroes and divinities. They afterwards
learn the music of Philoxenus and Timotheus. They dance to
the pipe in the theatres at the annual festival of Bacchus; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
they do this with great emulation, the boys performing mock-fights
adapted to their age, and the young men the so-called
manly fights. In like manner throughout the whole of life
their pleasure at feasts and entertainments consists, not in listening
to singers hired for the purpose, but in singing themselves
in their turns when called upon. For, although a man
may decline any other performance on the ground of inability
and may thereby bring no imputation on himself, no one can
refuse to sing, because all have been obliged to learn it, and to
refuse to take a part, when able, is deemed disgraceful. The
young men also unite together to perform in order all the military
steps and motions to the sound of the pipe, and at the
public expense they exhibit them every year before their fellow-citizens.
Besides these ballets, marches, and mock-fights, the
men and women unite in great public assemblies and in numerous
sacrifices, to which are to be added the circular or choral
dances by the boys and virgins.” Polybius adds, that these
musical exercises had been ordained as the means of communicating
softness and refinement to the otherwise rough and laborious
life of the Arcadians, and he warns them by the example
of the half-savages of Cynæthæ never to abandon such
wholesome institutions<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>. With how great benefit to our own
social character might we adopt this counsel! How greatly
might we contribute both to the innocent enjoyment and to the
more improved and elevated tastes of our rustics and artisans,
if well-regulated plans were devised, by which graceful recreations,
providing at the same time exercise for the body, amusement
for the imagination, and employment for the finer and
more amiable feelings, were made to relieve the degrading and
benumbing monotony of their protracted labors, whether in the
factory or in the field!</p>

<p>It will be readily perceived, that the education here described,
and the tastes and habits which it produced, were immediately
associated with the popular religion, and especially with the
notions and rites entertained towards the peculiar god of the
shepherds. Other deities indeed, such as Apollo, Diana, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Minerva, who were also worshipped in Arcadia, may have contributed
to the same effect; and especially this may have been
the case with Mercury, perhaps the only one of the higher Greek
divinities, who was conceived to have a benevolent character,
who was the father of Pan, and was himself reported to have
been born in a cave of the same mountain in Arcadia, on which
he was worshipped. He was a lover of instrumental music,
having invented the lyre, and he was frequently represented on
coins and gems, riding upon a ram, or with his emblems so
connected with the figures of sheep, and more rarely of goats
and of dogs, as to prove that in his character as the god of gain
the shepherds looked up to him together with his offspring to
bless the flocks and to increase their produce<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>. Hence Homer,
in order to convey the idea that Phorbas was remarkably successful
in the breeding of sheep, says that he was beloved by
Mercury above all the other Trojans<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. The inhabitants of one
territory even in Arcadia, viz. the city of Phineos, honored
Mercury more than all the other gods, and expressed this sentiment
by procuring a statue of him made by a celebrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
sculptor in Ægina, in which he was represented carrying a ram
under his arm, and which they placed in the great temple of
Jupiter at Olympia<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. At Corinth there was a brazen statue of
Mercury in a sitting posture with a ram standing beside him.
According to Pausanias (ii. 3, 4.) the reason of this representation
was, that of all the gods Mercury was thought most to
take care of flocks and to promote their increase. But, as the
Corinthians had little or nothing to do with the tending of
sheep and were devoted to commerce, we may ask what interest
had they in this attribute of Mercury? It is very evident
that it could only be an interest arising from the part which Corinth
took in the wool-trade. That the Arcadians did not
themselves consume their wool is manifest. How could they
have built cities, which were so large, numerous, and handsome
in proportion to the extent of their country, and have lived
even in that degree of elegance and luxury, to which they attained,
<i>unless they had been able to dispose of the chief produce
of their soil in a profitable manner</i>? It is probable
therefore, that the representation of Mercury or of his emblems
in conjunction with the figure of the sheep on the coins of Corinth
and Patræ may be regarded as an intimation, that the
Arcadians disposed of their wool in those cities for exportation
to foreign countries.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_303" href="#FNanchor_303" class="label">[303]</a> Buonaroti (Osservazioni sopra alcuni Medaglioni Antichi, p. 41.) has exhibited
brass coins, in one of which Mercury is riding on a sheep; in a second the
sheep is seen with Mercury’s bag of money on its back; and in a third the caduceus
is over the sheep, and two spikes of corn, emblems of agricultural prosperity,
spring out of the ground before it. Among the gems of the Baron de
Stosch, now belonging to the Royal Cabinet at Berlin, No. 381. Class II. represents
Mercury sitting upon a rock with a dog by his side: Winckelmann observes,
that “the dog is the symbol of Mercury as the protector of shepherds.”
Nos. 392, 393, 396-402, in the same collection, represent him with sheep, and
one of them (399.) exhibits him standing erect in a chariot drawn by four rams,
and holding the bag or purse in his right hand and the caduceus in his left.</p>

<p>Some of the coins of Sicily appear to refer in like manner to the character of
Mercury as the promoter of the trade in wool.</p>

<p>The Honorable Keppel Craven (Excursions in the Abruzzi, London, 1838, vol.
i. ch. 4. p. 109.) mentions a temple at Arpinum, a city of Latium, which was
dedicated, as appears from an inscription found on its site, to MERCURIUS LANARIUS.
This title evidently represented Mercury as presiding over the
growth of wool and the trade in it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the very ancient idea of Mercury making the fleece of Phryxus
golden by his touch may have originated in the same view. See Apollonius
Rhodius, Argonautica, l. 11. 1144, and Scholion ad locum.</p>

</div>

<p>But, notwithstanding the important share, which Mercury
had in the religious sentiments and observances of the Arcadians,
the proper god of the shepherds of Arcadia was Pan, and
we have already had abundant evidence to suggest the conviction,
that their songs and dances were performed principally in
honor of him, and were supposed to be taught, guided, and
animated by him.</p>

<p>Arcadia has for many centuries exhibited a most melancholy
contrast to that condition of hardy and yet peaceful independence,
of rustic simplicity united with tasteful elegance, of social
kindness and domestic enjoyment undisturbed by the projects
of ambition, which has supplied many of the most beautiful
pictures to the writers of poetry and romance. The great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
natural features of the country are unalterable. The pine-forests
of Lycæus, its deep glens continually refreshed with sparkling
streams and cataracts, its savage precipices where scarce
even a goat can climb, remain in their original beauty and
grandeur. This region also affords pasture to flocks of sheep
more numerous than those which feed in any other part of
Greece<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. But whatever depends on the moral nature of man
is changed. The valleys, once richly cultivated and tenanted
by an overflowing population, are scarcely kept in tillage.
The noble cities are traced only by their scattered ruins. The
few descendants of the ancient Arcades have crouched beneath
a degrading tyranny. The thick forests and awful caverns
but a few years ago served to shelter fierce banditti; and the
traveller startled at the sound of their fire-arms instead of being
charmed with the sweet melody of the syrinx<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. But a new
dynasty has been established under the sanction of the most
powerful and enlightened nations of Europe. It remains to be
seen whether this or any other part of Greece will again become
wise, virtuous, and renowned. The philanthropist, who
amidst the gloom and desolation of the moral world depends
with confidence upon an all-wise and all-disposing Providence,
may console himself with the hope, that that great Being who
bestowed such inestimable blessings upon Arcadian shepherds in
their ignorance, will not abandon those of their descendants,
who with superior means of knowledge, aim at corresponding
attainments in the excellencies of political, social, and private life.</p>

</div>

<p>According to the representation in the Odyssey (xiv. 100.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Ulysses had twelve flocks of sheep, and as many of goats on the
continent opposite to Ithaca. At a much later period Neoptolemus,
a king of Molossis, in possession of flocks and herds,
which were superintended by a distinct officer appointed for the
purpose<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>. In Macedonia also the king, though living in a state
of so little refinement that his queen <i>baked the bread for the
whole household</i>, was possessed at an early period of flocks of
sheep and goats together with horses and herds of oxen,
which were entrusted to the care of separate officers. We are
informed that three Argive brothers, having taken refuge in the
upper part of Macedonia bordering upon Illyria, became hired
servants to the king, one of them having the custody of the
horses, another of the oxen, and a third of the sheep and
goats<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>. Here then we find in Europe a state of society <i>analogous
to that which</i>, as we have seen, <i>existed in Palestine
under David</i>. Indeed we may observe, that all the countries
bordering on Macedonia were contrasted with Attica and Arcadia
in this respect, that, while the Athenians and Arcadians
were in general small landed proprietors, each shepherd tending
his flock upon his own ground, Phrygia<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>, Thrace, Macedonia,
Epirus, and even Bœotia belonged probably to an aristocracy,
the richest and most powerful individuals of which became
shepherd kings, their landed possessions giving them a superiority
over the rest of their countrymen, and leading to the employment
of numerous persons as their servants engaged in
tending their cattle and in other rural occupations.</p>

<p>Respecting the attention paid to sheep-breeding in Epirus
we have the testimony of Varro in his treatise De Re Rustica.
He informs us (ii. 2.) that it was usual there to have one man
to take care of 100 coarse-wooled sheep (<i>oves hirtæ</i>), and two
men for the same number of “<i>oves pellitæ</i>,” or sheep which
wore skins. The attention bestowed upon dogs is an indirect
evidence of the care which was devoted to flocks. It is worthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
of remark, that the dogs used to guard the flocks in the modern
Albania, appear to be the genuine descendants of the ancient
“canes Molossici,” being distinguished by their size as well as
by their strength and ferocity<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. Further notices respecting
them may be found in Virgil’s Georgics, l. iii. 404-413, and in

</div>
</div>

<p>There is another important circumstance, in which probably
the habits of the modern shepherds of Albania are similar to
those of the ancient occupants of the same region, viz. the annual
practice of resorting to the high grounds in summer and
returning to the plains in winter, which prevails both here and
in most mountainous countries devoted to sheep-breeding. The
following extract from Dr. Holland’s Travels in the Ionian Isles,
Albania, &amp;c. (<i>p.</i> 91-93.), gives a lively representation of this
proceeding:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When advanced eight or nine miles on our journey (from Cinque Pozzi to
Joannina; October 31st, 1813,) and crossing another ridge of high and broken
land, we were highly interested in a spectacle, which by a fortunate incident occurred
to our notice. We met on the road a community of migrating shepherds,
a wandering people of the mountains of Albania, who in the summer feed their
flocks in these hilly regions, and in the winter spread them over the plains in the
vicinity of the Gulph of Arta and along other parts of the coast. The many
large flocks of sheep we had met the day before belonged to these people, and
were preceding them to the plains. The cavalcade we now passed through was
nearly two miles in length with few interruptions. The number of horses with
the emigrants might exceed a thousand; they were chiefly employed in carrying
the moveable habitations and the various goods of the community, which were
packed with remarkable neatness and uniformity<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. The infants and smaller children
were variously attached to the luggage, while the men, women, and elder
children travelled for the most part on foot; a healthy and masculine race of people,
but strongly marked by the wild and uncouth exterior connected with their
manner of life. The greater part of the men were clad in coarse white woollen
garments; the females in the same material, but more curiously colored, and
generally with some ornamented lacing about the breast.” He then adds,
“These migratory tribes of shepherds generally come down from the mountains
about the latter end of October, and return thither from the plains in April,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
after disposing of a certain proportion of their sheep and horses. In travelling,
they pass the night on the plains or open lands. Arrived at the place of their
destination, they construct their little huts or tents of the materials they carry
with them, assisted by the stones, straw, or earth, which they find on the spot.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="Footnote_312" href="#FNanchor_312" class="label">[312]</a> No one has described this pastoral migration more minutely or more beautifully,

</div>
</div>

<p>According to Dr. Sibthorp (<i>in Walpole’s Memoirs</i>, <i>p.</i> 141.),
“a wandering tribe of Nomads” on the other side of Greece
drive their flocks from the mountains of Thessaly into the
plains of Attica and Bœotia to pass the winter. “They give
some pecuniary consideration to the Pasha of Negropont and
Vaivode of Athens. These people are much famed for their
woollen manufactures, particularly the coats or cloaks worn by
the Greek sailors.”</p>

<p>We now pass over to <i>Sicily</i>. The pastoral life of the Sicilians
was marked by peculiar characters as well as that of the
Arcadians. The bucolic poems of Theocritus represent many
of its circumstances in the most lively colors; and, while their
dramatic spirit and vivacity are unrivalled, they seem to be
most exact copies of nature, the dialogues which they contain
being in the style, the language, and the precise dialect of the
Sicilian shepherds, and indeed only differing from their real
conversation by being composed in hexameters. It is to be
observed, that the mountains and pastures of Sicily were
browsed by goats and oxen as well as by sheep. These animals
were, however, under distinct keepers, called respectively
Shepherds, Goatherds, and Herdsmen. But the tastes, manner
of life, and the superstitions of these three classes of rustics appear
to have been undistinguishable. They were probably not
always independent proprietors of the soil, but in many cases
the servants of a landed aristocracy who lived in <i>Syracuse</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
other splendid cities. They appear, however, to have enjoyed
far greater comforts and advantages than the corresponding
class of hired laborers in the countries to the north of the Peloponnesus
and of Attica. In composing pastoral verses and in
playing on the pipe and the syrinx they probably equalled the
Arcadians. Whilst they were watching their flocks and herds,
it was a frequent amusement with them for two persons to contend
for a stipulated prize, such as a goat, a carved wooden
bowl, or a syrinx, which was to be awarded by an appointed
judge to him who most excelled either in instrumental music,
or in singing alternate and extemporaneous verses<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_313" href="#FNanchor_313" class="label">[313]</a> According to the learned German traveller, Baron Riedesel, the custom was
not extinct in his time; for in his Travels through Sicily, page 148 of Forster’s
English translation, he says, “The shepherds still sing with emulation to gain the
crook or the purse, which is the prize of the best performer.” Nevertheless, the
modern can be only a very faint imitation of the ancient practice; for thus the
same author speaks in other passages:</p>

<p>“Here I had an opportunity of pitying the wretched situation of modern Sicily
in comparison with what it was in former ages. Many towns and different nations
are destroyed; immense riches are dissipated; the whole island can at present
scarce show 1,200,000 inhabitants, <i>the number which Syracuse alone formerly
had</i>. Many beautiful spots, which used to produce corn and fruits, are now
deserted for want of laborers; many spacious ports are without any ships for want
of trade; and many people want bread, <i>whilst the nobility and the monks</i> are in
possession of all the lands.” p. 112, 113.</p>

<p>“To conclude, the climate, the soil, and the fruits of the country are as perfect
as ever. But the precious Greek liberty, population, power, magnificence, and
good taste, are now not to be met with as in former times, and the present inhabitants
can only say, Fuimus Troes.” p. 151.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>That this elegant recreation was of Sicilian origin we have
clear and abundant evidence. Bion (<i>Idyll</i> vii. 1.) calls pastoral
poetry “a Sicilian strain;” which certainly implies, that of
all places where the Greek language was used Sicily was the
most noted for it, and that in fact it properly belonged to Sicily.
So Moschus (<i>Idyll</i> iii.) speaks of “the Sicilian muses;” and
throughout this Idyll, which is the lament of Moschus on the
death of Bion, he repeatedly speaks of the pastoral poetry, such
as Bion cultivated, as proper to Sicily. In Virgil’s Bucolics we
find frequent allusions to the same acknowledged fact. Thus
he says,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will set my verses to the tune of a Sicilian shepherd.”</p>

<p><i>Buc.</i> x. 51.</p>
</div>

<p>The historian Diodorus, himself a Sicilian, who lived about
the commencement of the Christian æra, supposes bucolic poetry
and music to be the peculiar invention and exercise of his
own country, and says, that it continued in use at his time and
was held in the same estimation as formerly<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>. In less than
200 years from this period the art lost much of its original simplicity.
Maximus Tyrius (Diss. xxi.) says, that “the Dorians
of Sicily became, to use the mildest term, <i>more weak in
understanding</i>,” (<i>more dissolute</i>) “when instead of the simple
Alpine music, which they used to employ in the presence of
their flocks and herds, they began to love the tunes of the Sybarites,
and a style of dancing adapted to them, such as was required
by the Ionic pipe.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_314" href="#FNanchor_314" class="label">[314]</a> L. iv. c. 84, p. 283.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But, although the rustic Dorians of Sicily had the full credit
of this invention and were never surpassed in the practice of it
by any other people, yet the imitation of it was attempted in
various instances by the pastoral inhabitants of other countries.
More especially, it appears to have been adopted in the neighboring
district of Magna Græcia; for it is near <i>Sybaris</i> that
Theocritus has placed the scene of his Fifth Idyll, in which, a
shepherd having staked a lamb and a goatherd a kid, they
contend in alternate verses, whilst a wood-cutter, whom they
have called from his labor, listens as judge, and awards the
prize to the goatherd, who hereupon joyfully sacrifices his newly
acquired lamb to the Nymphs.</p>

<p>In the Seventh Idyll (<i>v.</i> 12, 27, 40.) Theocritus mentions
the goatherd, <i>Lycidas</i> of Crete, who was his contemporary,
and also his predecessors and supposed instructors, <i>Asclepiades
of Samos</i>, and <i>Philetas of Cos</i>, as distinguished for skill in
pastoral music.</p>

<p>The bucolic poems of Theocritus prove, that the Arcadian
belief in the attributes of Pan had extended itself into Sicily
and the South of Italy, so that the rustics of those countries
not only invoked him by name, but even sometimes offered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
sacrifices to him. Thus, in Idyll v. 58, the Lucanian goatherd
already referred to says, that he will set aside for Pan eight
dishes of milk and six of honey.</p>

<p>But besides importing the belief in Pan from Arcadia the
Sicilians recognized two demigods of native origin, who contributed,
if not to excite feelings allied to religion, at least to
amuse their imagination and to contribute greatly to the variety
and liveliness of their poetry. These were the shepherd
Polyphemus, who was horridly deformed, and the herdsman
Daphnis, who was endowed with the most surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>Polyphemus was the son of Neptune. Notwithstanding his
forbidden aspect he is represented as susceptible of some tender
emotions, and it is his misfortune to be deeply enamored of the
beautiful <i>Nereid</i> or Mermaid Galatea, whom he sees sporting
in the green waves, while he surveys the coast from the summit
of a mountain and plays upon the syrinx for the amusement
of himself and his flock<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The Sicilian Daphnis, like the Arcadian Pan, was the son
of Mercury and of a mountain nymph, and excelled in playing
on the syrinx; but his form was entirely human and the most
beautiful that could be imagined.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The guardian of fair kine, himself more fair.</p>

<p><i>Virg. Buc.</i> v. 44.</p>
</div>

<p>
He tended his cattle upon the picturesque Heræan mountains
to the north of Ætna, and did not mix in the society of men.
At the time when the beard was beginning to grow on his upper
lip, the nymph Echenais became enamored of him, and
enjoined him upon pain of losing his eye-sight not to approach
any other female. He consented, and for some time persisted
in obeying her; but at length a Sicilian princess, having intoxicated
him with wine, accomplished her purpose. He shared
the fate of Thamyras, the Thracian, and was thus punished
for his folly<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. He then pined away, and died of hopeless love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
for the nymph, whom he had offended<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>. According to Virgil
(<i>Buc.</i> v. 56-71.) <i>he was raised to the stars</i>, and sacrifices
were offered to him by the shepherds.

<p>Daphnis was the frequent subject of pastoral poetry, being
regarded as an ideal representation of the perfection of the
shepherd’s culture and manner of life. Of this we have a
proof in the epigram of Callimachus on the death of Astacides,
and which concludes thus: “We (shepherds) will no longer
sing of Daphnis, but of Astacides.” The poet’s design was to
extol Astacides, by comparing him with Daphnis. According
to Ælian (<i>l. c.</i>) the first bucolic poems related to the blindness
of Daphnis and its cause; and the first poet, who composed
verses upon this subject, was Stesichorus of Himera in Sicily.
In Theocritus the allusions to the beautiful story of Daphnis
are very frequent<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>, and his sad fate is described at length by
contending shepherds or goatherds in the First and Seventh
Idylls. We shall quote only his dying words, where he calls
on Pan to leave the great Mænalus and the long ridges of
Lycæus, and to come to Sicily in order to receive from his own
hand the syrinx, on which he had been accustomed to play.</p>

<p>Pliny informs us, that in his time the wool of Apulia was
in the highest repute; that throughout the South of Italy the
best sheep were bred in the vicinity of Tarentum and Canusium;
and that the wool of Tarentum was admired for its
tinge of black, and that of Canusium for its fine brown or yellow
color<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.</p>

The directions for the management of sheep, given by Varro,
Columella, Virgil, and other writers on rural affairs, all tend
to show the pains taken by the Romans to improve the breed
of sheep, and especially to produce wool of the finest quality.</p>

<p>The first of these authors (<i>De Re Rustica</i>, L. ii. <i>Præf.</i>)
mentions his own flocks of sheep in Apulia. It appears from
his account that every man was obliged to report the number
of his sheep to the publican and to have them inscribed in a
register, the earliest allusion, to a code of laws, which may
probably have been in some respects similar to that now called
“La Mesta” in Spain. Varro further speaks expressly of the
summer and winter migrations of the flocks; and to show the
great distances to which they were conducted on these occasions,
he states that the sheep of Apulia were taken every
year to pass the summer in the mountains of Samnium, and
sometimes even in those of Reate<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Of the nature and circumstances of these annual migrations
we are enabled to form some judgment, not only from the animated
description already quoted from Dr. Holland in relation
to Albania, but still more distinctly from the following accounts
by the Honorable Keppel Craven, one of which relates to the
first group of mountains mentioned by Varro, the other to the
second.</p>

<p>In the year 1818 Mr. Craven visited a large farm a few
miles to the south of Foggia, and consequently not far from the
site of the ancient Arpi in Apulia. He mentions the following
particulars.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Above 200 persons were employed, and resided on the spot. The stock of
sheep consisted of 8000, divided into several flocks; to which those of cows, goats,
and buffaloes, together with a set of brood mares and a suitable quantity of poultry,
bore an equivalent proportion. All the cattle are guarded by large milk-white
dogs of the Abruzzo breed. These animals are very handsome and resemble the
Newfoundland species, but have sharper noses; they are very intelligent and
equally fierce. The flocks are tended by natives of Abruzzo, who also undertake
the care of milking them, as well as making the cheese, &amp;c.; they are assisted
by their wives and children, who accompany them in their yearly migrations to
and from the mountains. These shepherds are clothed in the skins of the animals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
which they watch, and are reckoned a quiet, attentive, frugal, and trust-worthy
race.” <i>Tour through the southern Provinces of the Kingdom of Naples, by the
Honorable Keppel Craven</i>, p. 80.</p>
</div>

<p>The scene of the following extract is the valley of the
Aternus, descending from the region of the highest Apennines,
the “montes Reatini” of Varro, not very remote from the ruins
of his farm and villa, (These ruins are described at page 45 of
the volume from which this passage is extracted.), and proceeding
towards the sites of the modern Aquila and of the ancient
Amiternum.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the broad tratturos, or cattle-paths, runs in the same line with the
high-road to Aquila; and I was so fortunate as to see it occupied by a very extended
line of flocks, which slowly passed by the carriage for the space of a mile
or more. The word ‘fortunate’ adapted to such a spectacle, may excite a smile
in my readers; but I own that I never beheld one of these numerous animal congregations
plodding across the flats of Capitanata, or the valleys of Abruzzo, as
far as the eye could reach, without experiencing a sensation of a novel and exciting
kind, nearly allied to that of enjoyment, but which I shall not attempt to
account for.</p>

<p>“One shepherd heads each division of cattle, of which he has the peculiar care
and direction. Armed with his crook, he walks some paces in advance of his
flock, followed by an old ram termed <i>il manso</i>; which word, meaning tame or
instructed, has undoubtedly a more apposite signification than that of our bell-wether,
though he is, as well as ours, furnished with a large deep-toned bell.</p>

<p>“The sheep march in files of about twelve in each; and every battalion, if I
may so call it, is attended by six or eight dogs, according to its number; these
accompanying the herd, walking at the head, middle, and rear of each flank.
The beauty and docility of these animals, which are usually white, has often been
described, and their demeanor is gentle as long as the objects of their solicitude
are unmolested, but at night they are so savage, that it would be dangerous to
approach the fold they guard.</p>

<p>“The goats, which bear a very small proportion to the sheep, and are in general
black, wind up the array, and evince their superior intelligence by lying down
whenever a temporary halt takes place. The cows and mares travel in separate
bodies. A certain number of these flocks, commonly those belonging to the same
proprietor, are under the immediate management and inspection of an agent, entitled
<i>fattore</i>, who accompanies them on horseback, armed with a musket, and
better clad than the shepherds, who, both in summer and winter, wear the large
<i>sheep-skin jacket</i>, and are in other respects provided with substantial though
homely attire, including good strong shoes.</p>

<p>“These Fattores are all natives of Abruzzo, an Apulian never having been
known to undertake the profession: the former, through particular habits and the
repeated experience of years, are looked upon as so peculiarly fitted for the care
required by cattle, and indeed animals of all kinds, that all the helpers in the stables
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
of the capital are natives of these provinces, or of the adjoining county of
Molise. In addition to these qualifications, they are esteemed an abstemious and
honest race.</p>

<p>“When following the calling of shepherds, and occupied, as I saw them, in the
duties of their charge in travelling, their countenances are almost invariably
marked by the same expression, which combines mildness and sagacity with immovable
gravity, and, it is painful to add, a look of deep-seated sadness; the
whole caravan, animal as well as human, exhibiting, at least while engaged in
one of those tedious peregrinations, a general appearance of suffering and depression,
distinguishable in every individual that composes it. The shepherd that
opens the march, the independent manso jingling his brazen bell, the flocks that
follow, the dogs that watch over their security, and even the Fattore who directs
the procession, all appear to be plodding through a wearisome existence of monotony
and toil. The extreme slowness of their progress, the downcast expression of
every head and eye, and, above all, the indications of exhaustion and fatigue
which are but too perceptible after a journey of more than a month’s duration,
may well account for this impression.</p>

<p>“The animals suffer greatly from heat until they reach their summer dwelling,
and full as much from lameness, which, when it has reached a certain pitch, becomes
the signal for destruction. I saw a mule bearing no other load than the
skins of those that had perished in this manner.</p>

<p>“Several other beasts of burden follow the rear of the herds, laden with the various
articles necessary for them and their guardians during their protracted
march: these consist in the nets and poles requisite to pen the folds at night, the
coarse cloth tents for the use of the shepherds, and a limited stock of utensils for
milking, and boiling the produce of the flock. Among these are to be noticed
some portable jointed seats of very ingenious though simple construction, composed
of the stems of the giant fennel, a substance remarkable for its light and
compact texture.</p>

<p>“The cattle which I thus met near Aquila were within two days’ journey of
their resting-place, which is generally in some of the valleys placed on the lower
flanks of the mountain ridges, but sufficiently elevated above the larger plains to
afford fresh and abundant herbage and a cooler temperature.</p>

<p>“The duration of their abode in these regions is regulated by the rapid or slow
progression of the summer season; in the course of which they shift their quarters,
as the heat increases, till they reach the highest spots, which are the last divested
of the deep snows, in which they have been buried during three quarters
of the year. Here large tracts of the finest pasture, rills of the coldest and purest
water, and shady woods of considerable extension, are occupied by them during
the remainder of the fine weather, and afford the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of enjoyment allotted
to an existence of such restricted variety.” <i>Excursions in the Abruzzi by
the Honorable Keppel Craven.</i> <i>London</i>, 1838, <i>vol.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 259-264.</p>
</div>

<p>The account, given in the second paragraph of this extract,
of the shepherd marching at the head of his battalion of sheep
illustrates in a striking manner the remark made respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the comparison of kings to shepherds, and to their leading rams
in Homer and in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>The Greek word Κτίλος, originally an adjective, corresponds
exactly to the Italian <i>manso</i>. It appears to have been applicable
to all trained tame animals. Hence it was used specially
to denote the large and powerful ram, which was instructed to
assist the shepherd in disposing the sheep in proper order and
in leading them to and from their daily pasture as well as during
their long migrations. In the third book of the Iliad (<i>l.</i>
196-198), where Priam is described surveying the Greek troops
from the Scæan gate, after the account of Agamemnon, who
was considered as their shepherd, we find Ulysses, who was
inferior to him both in rank and in stature, represented as his
<i>manso</i>, that is, as the ram, which immediately follows the shepherd
and aids him in conducting the flock. The same image
is repeated in the thirteenth book (<i>l.</i> 492, 493), where Pope’s
translation, though very paraphrastic, is an admirable representation
of the real circumstances.</p>

<p>Aristotle calls these rams “the leaders of the sheep,” and he
states, that the shepherds provided for each flock such a leader,
<i>which, when called by name by the shepherd, placed himself
at the head of the flock</i>, and was trained to execute this office
from an early age<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. The employment of the <i>manso</i> was probably
the ground, on which many of the Orientals adopted the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
ram as the emblem of military authority<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>. According to this
supposition it would rather denote secondary than supreme
command; and if so, <i>the representation of the king of Persia
by the symbol of a ram in the 8th chapter of Daniel is the
more expressive, because it indicated that he was the agent
of the supreme Deity</i>. Probably also the same sentiment was
intended to be conveyed by the enthusiastic Sapor, or Shahpoor
II., King of Persia in the <i>fourth century</i>, when he rode
to battle in front of his army wearing instead of a diadem a
ram’s head wrought in gold and studded with precious stones<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>.</p>

<p>Any one, who has seen the collection of ancient bronze bells
in the Museum at Naples, and compared them with those now
worn in Italy about the necks of sheep and other cattle, will be
struck with their similarity. We know also from various ancient
laws and other evidence<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> that the shepherds fastened bells
upon their sheep as they do at the present day.</p>

<p>There is a striking correspondence between the words of
Varro, “crates, retia, cæteraque utensilia,” and Craven’s account
of the provision of nets, &amp;c. for making folds, and of the
other necessary utensils.</p>

<p>At Sepino, the ancient Sæpinum, situated in the highest part
of the mountains of Samnium near the source of the Tamarus,
Mr. Craven saw over the Eastern gate the remains of a very
remarkable inscription referring to the same practice<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>. This
inscription has been accurately published by Muratori<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. It
clearly distinguishes between the “fattores” (<i>conductores gregum
oviaricorum</i>) and the shepherds who were under them
(<i>pastores quos conductores habent</i>). These were molested
by the magistrates of Sæpinum and the neighboring town of
Bovianum, and by the “stationarii” or soldiers, who, instead
of being ready to protect them in case of need, charged them
with being fugitives and with cattle-stealing, and under this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
pretence drove back even those sheep which belonged to the
emperor (<i>oves quoque dominicas</i>) and thus greatly injured his
revenue. These grievances were consequently represented to
an officer at Rome who kept the emperor’s accounts (<i>Cosmus,
Augusti Libertus a Rationibus</i>); and he writes in the terms
of the inscription to Basseus Rufus and Macrinus Vindex, officers
of rank in the army, in order that the evil might be remedied.
This inscription must have been erected about the commencement
of the Christian æra. As Mr. Craven remarks,
“It not only corroborates what was already known, that the
periodical migration of the herds from Apulia is of most ancient
origin, but it proves, that they observed the same line of route
which they follow to the present day; the road, that runs from
the east to the western gate of this inclosure, falling into the
line of the <i>tratturos</i>, or sheep-paths, exclusively allotted to the
use of the flocks in their annual journeys.”</p>

<p>Whilst we discover these numerous points of resemblance
between the ancient and the modern practice, it is probable that
in other respects there was a greater diversity. If the author
whose observations have been cited had witnessed a similar procession
in very ancient times, he would have seen less reason to
deplore its toilsome and melancholy aspect. Music was then
probably of no little service in animating both the shepherds
and their flocks. The sonorous <i>bagpipe</i> may have contributed
to this effect<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>. At least Mr. Craven’s account of a modern
pastoral march is strikingly contrasted with the following description
by Apollonius Rhodius, in which he compares the
ship Argo and the music of Orpheus, followed by multitudes of
fishes, to a shepherd playing on the syrinx and followed by his
sheep.</p>

<p>The testimony afforded by Varro relative to the management
of the South Italian sheep, having been given and illustrated,
it is to be deplored that Italy, once so renowned for its sheep,
can now boast little of this production of her bounteous clime.
The Romans, whose dress was woollen, cultivated in an especial
degree the fineness of the fleece; and it was not until the
days of the Empire that the silk and cotton of the East began
to supersede the ancient raiment of the Roman people. The
finest wools of ancient Italy were produced in Apulia and Calabria,
being the eastern parts of the present kingdom of Naples<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_328" href="#FNanchor_328" class="label">[328]</a> It appears from the following passage of Varro, that the Apulian was sold at
a higher price than some other kinds of wool which were equally beautiful, because
it wore better. By <i>lana Gallicana</i> in this passage we must understand
the wool of Gallia Cisalpina, of which we shall next treat.</p>

<p>Sic enim lana Gallicana et Appula videtur imperito similis propter speciem,
cum peritus Appulam emat pluris, quod in usu firmior sit.</p>

<p class="right">
<i>De Lin. Lat.</i>, lib. ix. 28. p. 484. ed. Spengel.<br />
</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>We now proceed to the other writers on Rural Affairs, viz.,
Columella and Palladius.</p>

<p>The first attests the high estimation in which the sheep of
Calabria and Apulia were held by the Romans, especially before
his own time, and he says that among them the Tarentine
sheep were the best of all. In speaking of the practice so prevalent
in this district of covering them with skins, he shows,
that these “oves pellitæ” were also called “soft” (<i>molles</i>), and
“covered” (<i>tectæ</i>). Indeed he makes the great distinction of
sheep to be into the “<i>genus molle</i>,” i. e. the soft kind, and the
“genus hirsutum,” or “hirtum,” i. e. the coarse kind. We
further learn that the soft sheep were called by the Romans
Greek sheep, because they were bred in Græcia Magna, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Tarentine, because the best of all were bred at Tarentum.
According to Palladius they were also sometimes called Asiatic
(<i>Asianæ</i>). It is to be observed that by <i>Asia</i>, Palladius and
his contemporaries would understand the celebrated sheep-country
of which Miletus was the centre<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>; and considering the
frequent, long-established, and very friendly intercourse between
Miletus and Tarentum<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>, we may infer that the Milesians
imported into Tarentum their fine breed of sheep, and at
the same time introduced the art of <i>dyeing</i> and <i>preparing</i> the
wool. The same sheep, which were called Greek by the Romans,
were called <i>Italian</i> by the Egyptians and others, to
whom the word <i>Greek</i> would not have been distinctive. Columella
(vii. 4.) insists particularly on the great pains and care,
which it was necessary to bestow upon this description of sheep,
the “covered” or “soft,” in regard to food, warmth, and cleanliness,
and he says that they were principally brought up in the
house<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.</p>

fastened upon them with thongs or buckles.</p>

<p>In the sheep-breeding countries of Europe the practice seems to have been
very general. Besides South Italy, Attica, Megaris, and Epirus, in regard to
which countries positive evidence has been produced, we find that soft sheep, or
“oves pellitæ” were kept by an inhabitant of Cynethæ in Arcadia (Polybius, L.
ix. c. 17.), by the Roman settlers in the North of Gaul and in Spain.</p>

<p>As there was in general a great affinity between the manners
and ideas of Sicily and South Italy, we might infer that the
pastoral habits of these two districts were in many respects
similar. Theocritus accordingly lays the scene of some of his
Idylls on the coast opposite to Sicily. The fifth Idyll describes
a contest between a shepherd and a goatherd, who are supposed
to have been employed as hired servants in the vicinity
of Sybaris. The shepherd, observing some of his sheep to be
feeding on an oak, which could not be very good for them, utters
the following exclamation, showing that it was customary
to give proper names to sheep, and thus confirming the fact,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
that in ancient times they were regarded as the objects of affection,
and not of profitable speculation merely:</p>

<p>The passage has often been cited in illustration of the following
verses from the Gospel of St. John. Our Savior, describing
himself as a shepherd, here alludes to various indications of
care and attachment, which distinguish the owner of a flock
from the hireling, who, being engaged to tend the sheep only
for a season, could not be so well known by them, nor so much
interested in their security and welfare.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he
putteth forth (from the fold) his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep
follow him; for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but
will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.”&mdash;<i>John</i>, x. 3-5.</p>
</div>

<p>In reference to this passage of Scripture the following remarks
of a late traveller are instructive:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I asked my man if it was usual in Greece to give names to sheep. He informed
me that it was, and that the sheep obeyed the shepherd when he called
them by their names. This morning (<i>March 5, 1828</i>), I had an opportunity of
verifying the truth of this remark. Passing by a flock of sheep, I asked the
shepherd the same question which I put to my servant, and he gave me the same
answer. I then bade him to call one of his sheep. He did so, and it instantly
left its pasturage and its companions, and ran up to the hand of the shepherd,
with signs of pleasure and with a prompt obedience which I had never before observed
in any other animal. It is also true of the sheep in this country, <i>that a
stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the
voice of the strangers</i>. The shepherd told me that many of his sheep are still
<span class="allsmcap">WILD</span>; that they had not yet learned their names; but that by teaching they
would all learn them. The others, which knew their names, he called <span class="allsmcap">TAME</span>.”&mdash;<i>Researches
in Greece and the Levant, by the Rev. John Hartley</i>, p. 321.</p>
</div>

<p>The city of Sybaris stood between two rivers, the Sybaris
and the Crathis. The ancients asserted that the sheep which
drank of the Crathis, were white, and those which drank of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
Sybaris, black. They attributed similar virtues to other
streams in various parts of the world<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.</p>

<p>According to Strabo (L. vi. <i>cap.</i> 3. § 9. <i>p.</i> 303. <i>ed. Siebenkees</i>)
the hilly promontory of Garganus was particularly celebrated
for its sheep. He says, that their wool was softer than the
Tarentine, but less shining.</p>

<p>The Roman poets allude in various instances to the excellence
of the Apulian wool, and especially to that of Tarentum.
Horace in the following stanza expresses his predilection for this
celebrated city, and mentions its “soft” or “covered” sheep.
He had been asserting his wish to end his days at Tibur, the
modern Tivoli.</p>

<p>The following epigram (L. viii. <i>ep.</i> 28.) was written on the
receipt of a handsome toga from the wealthy and munificent
Parthenius, chamberlain to the emperor Domitian. In expressing
his admiration of it, the poet enumerates the places from
which the Romans of his time obtained the best and most
fashionable garments of this description. He next proceeds to
extol its whiteness; and in conclusion observes how ridiculous
he would appear wearing his old <i>lacerna</i> over this new and
snowy garment, and he thus conveys a hint to Parthenius how
acceptable and suitable would be the present of a lacerna in addition
to the toga.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that in this ingenious epigram, as well
as in two of the preceding, which relate to togas, Martial supposes
the Tarentine wool to be white: for the Roman toga was
of that color except in mourning, and one object of the last-cited
epigram is to praise the whiteness of the particular toga, which it
describes. The Tarentines therefore must have produced both
dark-colored and white fleeces.</p>

<p>The fifth passage of Martial (xii. 64.), which mentions the
sheep of the Galesus, more directly refers to those of Spain, and
will therefore be quoted under that head.</p>

<p>Besides the epigrams, now cited, in which Martial commends
the wool of Tarentum in particular, we find others, in which
he celebrates that of Apulia in general. In Book xiv. Ep. 155.
he gives an account of the principal countries, which yielded
white wools, and informs us that those of the first quality were
from Apulia.</p>

  </div>

<p>Also in the following lines Martial alludes to the large and numerous
flocks of Apulia, and to the whiteness of their wool.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand the wool from the vicinity of Canusium
was no less esteemed for its dark colors, whether inclining to
brown or to red. These saved the expense of dyeing. The
testimony of Pliny to their value has been already produced.
In the two following Epigrams (<i>l.</i> xiv. 127 <i>and</i> 129.) Martial
alludes to the peculiar recommendations and uses, first of the
brown, and secondly of the reddish variety.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_333" href="#FNanchor_333" class="label">[333]</a> It appears from this epigram that, when shaken, it had the color of the brown
wool of Canusium, a kind of drab. The lacerna was a mantle, which the Romans
wore out of doors over their white toga, with which it was well contrasted,
whether it was purple, scarlet, or brown; but the last color, though less showy at
first, must have had the advantage of durability. See <a href="#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>On referring to the passages produced from Pliny, Columella,
and Martial, it will be seen that the Romans ascribed a very
high value to the white wool of Gallia Cisalpina, i. e. of North
Italy, or the region about the Po. Parma was considered second
only to Apulia for the whiteness of its wool. Besides the
two epigrams of Martial already cited, he refers to Parma as a
great place for sheep-breeding in the following passage, addressed
to the wealthy Callistratus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>And Gallic Parma shears thy num’rous flocks.</p>
<p class="right">L. v. <i>ep.</i> 13.</p>
</div>

<p>Columella speaks moreover (<i>l. c.</i>) of the superiority of the
wool of Mutina, now Modena; and Martial (<i>l.</i> v. <i>ep.</i> 105.)
mentions the circumstance of a <i>fuller</i>, or <i>clothier</i>, in that city
having exhibited a show to the public, which is a presumptive
evidence that he had a great business in manufacturing the
produce of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Strabo in his account of the productions of Cisalpine Gaul
divides the wool into three kinds; First, the soft kind, of which
the finest varieties were grown about Mutina and the river
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
Scutana, which is the modern Scultenna, a tributary of the
Po, rising in the Apennines; Secondly, the coarse kind, grown
in Liguria and the country of the Insubres, which was very
much used for the common wearing apparel of the Italians;
and Thirdly, the middle kind, grown about Patavium (now
Padua) and employed for making valuable <i>carpets</i> and various
descriptions of <i>blankets</i><a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>. By comparing the statements of
this author with those of Columella and Martial it will appear,
that the whole region watered by the parallel rivers Parma,
Gabellus, and Scultenna, and known by the name of <i>Macri
Campi</i>, or the Barren Plains, was esteemed for the production
of the fine white wool.</p>

</div>

<p>That the tending of both sheep and goats was a principal
occupation of the people of Mantua we learn from Virgil, a
native of that city, who places the scene of most of his pastorals
in its vicinity. His First and Ninth Eclogues more particularly
relate to the calamities, which the Mantuans were compelled
to sustain, when Augustus seized on their lands to reward
his veteran soldiers after the battle of Philippi. These
eclogues mention flocks both of sheep and goats, and show that
those who had the care of them cultivated music and poetry
after the manner of the Sicilians. The commencement of the
Seventh Eclogue is especially instructive, because it gives us
reason to believe, that while many of the Arcadians left their
country in consequence of that excess of population, to which
mountainous regions are subject, in order to become foreign
mercenaries, others, on the contrary, entered into foreign service
as shepherds and goatherds, and in this condition not only
made themselves useful by their experience, skill, and fidelity,
but also introduced at the same time their native music together
with that refinement of manners and feelings which it
promoted. The poet thus describes two such individuals, who
had been employed in tending flocks upon the banks of the
Mincius (<i>l.</i> 12, 13), and who were either born in Arcadia, or
were at least of Arcadian origin.</p>

</div>

<p>At a considerable distance to the North-East of Mantua lay
Altinum, which is mentioned by Columella<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>, Tertullian, and
Martial, as one of the principal places for the produce of <i>white</i>
wool. Martial says, that it ranked in this respect next to Parma<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>,
and we must understand him as referring to the same
region in Book viii. Epig. 28, where he asks, “Did thy wool
count the many streams of the Timavus, which Cyllarus previously
drank with his starry mouth?” The Timavus was
indeed a considerable way still further towards the North-East,
and must have been very insignificant in connection with the
sheep-breeding of the Altinates. The poet introduces it here
only on account of its picturesque and mythological interest,
just as we have seen that the Galesus, a small, though clear and
very beautiful stream, is repeatedly named in order to designate
the pastoral region about Tarentum. It may also be observed,
that in this epigram, where Martial alludes to three of the principal
places for the growth of white wool, he indicates each of
them by its river, the three rivers being the Galesus, the Bætis,
and the Timavus; and he probably did so on account of the supposed
effect of the waters of these rivers in improving the wool.</p>

<p>We can make no question, after what we have seen of the
universal practice of both ancient and modern times, that the
sheep, which in the winter were pastured in the plains and
lower grounds about Altinum, were taken to pass the summer
in the vallies of the Carinthian Alps about the sources of the
Brenta, the Piave, and the Tagliamento. We may also trace
the wool, after it was manufactured, in its progress towards
Rome, where was the chief demand for garments of this description.
For Strabo says, that Patavium (<i>Padua</i>), which
was situated at no great distance from Altinum on the way to
Rome, was a great and flourishing mart for all kinds of merchandize
intended to be sent thither, and especially for every
kind of cloth<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. It appears, therefore, that the wool-growers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and clothiers of the country to the North-East of Padua, the
modern Trevisano, employed that city as an entrepôt where
they disposed of their goods to the Roman dealers. At the
same time we learn, that this place served as a market for <i>carpets</i>
and <i>blankets</i> made of a stronger and more substantial
material, which, according to the same authority<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>, was produced
in its more immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>In the North-Western portion of Cisalpine Gaul the wool
was generally coarse, and according to Strabo (<i>l. c.</i>) the garments
made of it were used by the Italians for the ordinary
clothing of their domestic establishments. Nevertheless, black
wool of superior value was grown at Polentia, now Polenza, on
the Stura, which is a tributary of the Po<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>. The following two

<p>Before quitting Italy we may properly inquire, whence and
how came the practice of sheep-breeding into Great Britain.
It has already been observed that the very improved state of
the art at Tarentum may be in part ascribed to the intercourse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
of its inhabitants with the Milesians. The reader will have
noticed the fact that the worship of Pan was introduced into
Italy from Arcadia by Evander, from which circumstance it
may be reasonably inferred, that improvements in the management
of sheep were also introduced at the same time. According
to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Evander with his companions
was said by the Romans to have migrated to Latium <i>about
sixty years before the Trojan war</i><a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. The same historian alleges
that this colony taught in Italy the use of letters, of instrumental
music and other arts, established laws, and brought
some degree of refinement instead of the former savage mode
of life. The story of the birth of Romulus and Remus supposes
sheep-breeding to have been practiced at the period of that
event, and in a state of society similar to that which we have
found prevailing further eastward; for it is stated, that Faustulus,
who discovered them, kept the king’s flocks. He was
“magister regii pecoris<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.”</p>

<p>As it has been a frequent error with nations to push back their annals into a
higher antiquity than was consistent with fact, this may have been the case in
the present instance. For it is to be observed, that according to Herodotus the
worship of Pan did not arise in Arcadia until after the time when according to
this latter statement it was introduced from Arcadia into Latium.</p>

<p>According to Pausanias (<i>l.</i> viii. <i>c.</i> 3. § 2.) the first Greek colony,
which went into Italy, was from Arcadia, being conducted
thither by Œnotrus, an Arcadian prince<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>. This was several
centuries before the expedition under Evander, and the part of
Italy thus colonized was the southern extremity, afterwards occupied
by the Bruttii<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>. If with Niebuhr we regard this tradition
only in the light of a genealogical table, designed to indicate
the affinities of tribes and nations, still the simple fact of the
colonization of South Italy by Arcadians certainly authorizes
the conjecture, that Arcadia was one of the stepping-stones, by
which the art of sheep-breeding was transported from Asia into
Europe.</p>

The reader will have perceived from the observations already
made on the worship of Faunus in Italy, that the Roman Faunus
was the same with the Arcadian Pan. It seems no sufficient
objection to this hypothesis, that a few Roman authors
have supposed Faunus to be either the son of Mars<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>, or of Picus
and the grandson of Saturn, thus connecting him with their
native mythology, or that his oracle was held by them in high
repute<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>. It is here sufficient to remark, that we find him extensively
recognized in Italy as a pastoral divinity.</p>

<p>From ancient monuments as well as from the language of
the poets we find, that the worship of other divinities was associated
with that of Faunus in reference to the success of all
agricultural pursuits including that of sheep-breeding. Boissard,
in the Fourth Part of his Antiquitates Romanæ, has published
somewhat rude engravings of the bas-reliefs upon two
altars, one of them (No. 130) dedicated to <i>Hope</i>, the other (No.
134) to <i>Silvanus</i>. The altar to Hope was erected, as the inscription
expresses, in a garden at Rome by M. Aur. Pacorus,
keeper of the temple of Venus. He says, that he had been admonished
to this deed of piety by <i>a dream</i>; and, if the representation
in the bas-relief was the image thus presented to his
mind, his dream was certainly a very pleasant one. Hope,
wearing on her head a wreath of flowers, places her right hand
upon a pillar and holds in her left poppy-heads and ears of corn.
Beside her is a bee-hive on the ground, and on it there is also
fixed a bunch of poppy-heads and ears of corn. Above these
emblems of the fruitfulness of the field and of the garden is the
figure of a bale of wool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
The altar to Silvanus exhibits that divinity crowned with
the cones and foliage of the pine. A pine grows moreover beside
his terminal statue, bearing the large cones, which were
used for food at entertainments and carried in bacchanalian
processions. Faunus, or Pan, sits at the foot of the pine, the
syrinx and the double pipe being placed at his feet. In his
right hand he holds an olive branch, while a young winged
genius advances towards him as if to receive it, and another
genius of the same kind appears to be caressing him and whispering
into his ear. On the other side of the terminal statue
of Silvanus we see the caduceus of Mercury and the bale of
wool, manifest indications of success in the wool trade. In this
sculpture the bale is surrounded with cords, which are twisted
round one another where they cross. In the former instance
the compression of the wool appears to be effected by the use
of thongs instead of cords<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. There is also introduced the figure
of a shepherd of the same country. This statue was found in
the vicinity of Rome and is now preserved in the Vatican<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>.
The extremities are in part restorations. A cameo in the Florentine
Museum<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> represents the shepherd Faustulus sitting
upon a rock, and contemplating the she-wolf, which is suckling
Romulus and Remus. It is of the Augustan age, and no doubt
exhibits the costume and general appearance of a Roman shepherd
of that period. He wears a <i>tunica cucullata</i>, i. e. a tunic
of coarse woollen cloth with a cowl, which was designed to be
drawn occasionally over the head and to protect it from the injuries
of the weather. This garment has also sleeves, which
Columella mentions (<i>tunica manicata</i>) as an additional comfort.
On his feet the shepherd wears high shoes, or boots,
which, as we may suppose, were made of leather.</p>

<p>The appearance of the shepherds, who are represented in
these ancient works of art, is, doubtless, adapted to produce the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
impression, that their condition, even if it were that of slaves,
was nevertheless one of comfort and respectability. Neither
their garb, nor their attitude, suggests the idea of anything
base or miserable. On the contrary, the countenance of each
indicates trust-worthiness, steadiness, and care. That many
of the agricultural laborers of ancient Italy had this character
may be inferred also from written testimonies.</p>

<p>In reference to this subject, and with a view to illustrate at
the same time the habits and employments of the ancient
farmer among the <i>Sabine</i> or <i>Apulian</i> mountains, we will here
quote some parts of Horace’s Second Epode, in which he describes
the pleasures of a country life.</p>

<p>According to Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>, the ancient Germans had abundance
of cattle, although we have no reason to suppose that they had
acquired any of that skill in sheep-breeding, by which their
successors in Silesia and Saxony are now distinguished. On
the contrary, we are informed by the same author that the
only woollen garment, which they commonly wore, was the
<i>Sagum</i>, a term implying the coarseness of the material<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>.</p>

<p>We find almost as little in any ancient author in favor of the

in the neighborhood of Pezenas in Provence<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. Martial’s

<p>In the following epigram of Martial (vi. 11.), addressed to his
friend Marcus, we observe a similar opposition between the fine
and fashionable cloth of Tyre, and the thick coarse “sagum”
produced in Gaul.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>Juvenal gives exactly the same account of the woollen manufactures
of Gaul. In the following passage the needy dependant
of a rich man is speaking of the lacernas from that country,
which were sometimes presented to him by his patron.</p>

</div>

<p>To the same effect are several passages in the Epistles of
Sidonius Apollinaris, who was Bishop of Clermont in Auvergne
in the fifth century. He mentions, for example, that the attendants
on Prince Sigismer at his marriage wore green <i>Saga</i>
with red borders, and he describes a friend of his own as wearing
the Endromis<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>. Also in an account of his own villa he
speaks of the pipe with seven holes, as the instrument of the
shepherds and herdsmen, who used to entertain themselves during
the night with musical contests, while their cattle were
grazing with bells upon their necks.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>All these passages are confirmed and illustrated by the testimony
of Strabo. According to him Gaul produced cattle of all
kinds<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>. The Belgæ, who occupied the most northern part, opposite
to Britain, excelled the rest of the Gauls in their manufactures.
Nevertheless their wool was coarse, and was spun
and woven by them into the thick Saga, which were both worn
by the natives of the country and exported in great quantities
to Rome and other parts of Italy. The Roman settlers, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
in the most northern parts had flocks of covered sheep, and their
wool was consequently very fine<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Here also may be produced the evidence of Eumenius, who in
his Oration, which will be quoted more fully hereafter, intimates
the abundance of the sheep on the western banks of the Rhine
by saying, that the flocks of the Romans were washed in every
part of the stream<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Cæsar informs us, that the ancient inhabitants of Britain had
abundance of cattle (<i>pecoris magnus numerus</i>); under the
word (<i>pecus</i>) “cattle,” sheep must no doubt be understood to
be included. It also appears, that in his time the Celts, or
proper Britons, lived to the North of the Thames, the Belgians
having expelled them and taken possession of the part to the
South, called <i>Cantium</i> or <i>Kent</i>. These last were by far the
most civilized inhabitants of the island, not much differing in
their customs from the Gauls. With respect to the others,
Cæsar says, that for the most part they did not sow any kind
of grain, but lived upon milk and flesh, and clothed themselves
with skins<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>
</div>

<p>It appears therefore, that before our æra, sheep, and probably
goats, were bred extensively in England, their milk and flesh
being used for food, and their skins with the wool or hair upon
them for clothing; and that the people of Kent, who were of
Belgic origin, and more refined than the original Britons, had
attained to the arts of spinning and weaving, although their
productions were only of the coarsest description.</p>

<p>Eumenius, the Rhetorician, who was a native of Augustodunum,
now called Autun, delivered his Panegyric in praise of
the Emperors Constantius and Constantine in the city of
Treves about A. D. 310. In the following passage he congratulates
Britain on its various productions, and also on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
circumstance, that Constantine had been recently declared Emperor
at York on the death of his father:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

all the gifts both of Ceres and of Bacchus; thy woods contain no savage

<p>The improvements in sheep-breeding which were first introduced
into England by the Belgians, appear to have been advanced
still further by the Saxons.</p>

<p>The only country, which now remains to be surveyed in relation
to the production of sheep’s wool, is Spain; and, as this
kingdom retains its pre-eminence at the present day,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> so we
find none, in which sheep-breeding was carried to a greater extent
in ancient times.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_360" href="#FNanchor_360" class="label">[360]</a> For accounts of the state of sheep-breeding in modern Spain, including the
annual migration of the flocks, which is conducted there as in Italy, the reader

Translation. London, 1809.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Of all the countries in Europe, says Mr. Low, Spain has
been the longest distinguished for the excellence of its wool.
This fine country, more varied in its surface and natural productions
than any other region of the like extent in Europe,
produces a great variety of breeds of sheep, from the larger animals
of the richer plains, to the smaller races of the higher mountains
and arid country. Besides the difference produced in the
sheep of Spain by varieties of climate and natural productions;
the diversity of character in the animals may be supposed to
have been increased by the different races introduced into it:&mdash;first,
from Asia, by the early Phœnician colonies; secondly,
from Africa by the Carthaginians, during their brief possession;
thirdly, from Italy by the Romans, during their dominion of
six hundred years; and fourthly, again from Africa, by the
Moors, who maintained a footing in the country for nearly eight
centuries. The large sheep of the plains have long wool, often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
colored brown or black. The sheep of the mountains, downs,
and arid plains have short wool, of different degrees of fineness,
and different colors. The most important of these latter breeds
is the merino, now the most esteemed and widely diffused of all
the fine-wooled breeds of Europe.</p>

<p>Pliny not only refers in general terms to the various natural
colors of the Spanish wool, but mentions more particularly the
red wool produced in the district adjoining the river Bætis, or
Guadalquiver<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Among the natural colors of the Bætic wool, Columella, a
native of Cadiz, (vii. 2.) mentions, as has been already stated,
<i>gray</i> and <i>brown</i>. The latter is what we call <i>drab</i>, and the
Spaniards <i>fusco</i>. It is now commonly worn by the shepherds
and peasants of Spain, the wool being made into clothes without
dyeing.</p>

<p>Nonius Marcellus (<i>cap.</i> 16. <i>n.</i> 13), explaining the word <i>pullus</i>,
which was called a <i>native</i> color, because it was the natural
color of the fleece, also shows, that this was a common quality
of the Spanish wool. Another testimony is that of Tertullian.</p>

<p>The sheep of Tarentum were imported into this part of
Spain, and there also their fleeces were protected by clothing.
Columella (L. vii. 2.) gives a very interesting account of the
experiments made by his uncle, a great agriculturalist of Bætica,
in crossing his Tarentine breed with some wild rams of an extraordinary

<p>We have a further evidence of the pains taken to improve
the Spanish breed in the circumstance, that Italian shepherds
passed into Spain, just as we have formerly seen, that they migrated
into Italy from Arcadia. In the following lines of Calpurnius
(Ecl. iv. 37-49.), Corydon, a young shepherd, tells his
friend and patron, Melibœus, that he should have been transported
into Bætica, had not the times improved, and his master’s
favor enabled him to remain in Italy.</p>

<p>Juvenal in his Twelfth Satire (<i>l.</i> 37-42.) describes a merchant
overtaken by a dreadful storm, and to save the ship
throwing his most valuable goods into the sea. It will be observed,
that the poet attributes the excellence and fine natural
color of the woollen cloth of Bætica to three causes, the rich
herbage, the occult properties of the water, and those of the air.</p>

<p>Martial, a Spaniard by birth, frequently alludes to the sheep

wool, which were so much admired, that it was manufactured
without dyeing. Two of his epigrams (iv. 28. and viii. 28.)

<p>The numerous passages, which have now been produced
relative to the native colors of the Spanish wool, explain the
following line of Virgil, in which he describes the clothing of a
warrior;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
The poet probably intended to describe an outer garment, a
chlamys, made of undyed Spanish wool of a clear brown or
yellowish color, resembling that of rust; and afterwards enriched
with embroidery.</p>

<p>Ramirez de Prado, the Spanish commentator on Martial
(<i>4to. Paris</i>, 1607.), says, that two native colors were common
in Spain in his time, the one a golden yellow, the other more
brown or ferruginous.</p>

<p>In the North of Spain the Celtiberi wore saga made of a
coarse wool like goats’-hair (<i>Diod. Sic.</i> v. 33. <i>tom.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 356.
<i>Wesseling</i>.), and woven <i>double</i> according to Appian<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At Salacia in Lusitania, according to Pliny, a chequered pattern
was employed in the manufacture of the coarse wool. This
was in all probability the same as the shepherd’s plaid of the
Scotch, the weaver taking advantage of the natural difference
of the white and black wool to produce this variety of appearance.
(See <a href="#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>.)</p>

<p>Estremadura, a part of the ancient Bætica, is still famous for
its wool. There the Spanish flocks hybernate, and under the
direction of a peculiar code of laws, called <i>La Mesta</i>, are conducted
every spring to pasture in the mountains of Leon and
Asturias. Other flocks are led in the same season from great
distances to the heights of the Sierra Morena, lying to the east
of the ancient Bætica, where the vegetation is remarkably favorable
to the improvement of their wool.</p>

<p>As bearing directly upon the present inquiry it may be observed,
that sheep have always been bred principally for the
weaver, not for the butcher, and that this has been more especially
the case in ancient times and in eastern countries.</p>

<p>If we may judge from the following epigram of Martial, the
Romans regarded with feelings little short of aversion the act
of killing a sheep for food except on solemn or extraordinary
occasions.</p>

The customs of the shepherd tribes in the East are in this
respect remarkably like those of the ancients.</p>

<p>“The Arabs rarely diminish their flocks by using them for
food, but live chiefly upon bread, dates, milk, butter, or what
they receive in exchange for their wool. They however sell
their sheep to the people in the towns. A lamb or kid roasted
whole is a favorite dish at Aleppo, but seldom eaten except by
the rich<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.” When the Arabs have a sheep-shearing, they perhaps
kill a lamb, and treat their relations and friends with it
together with new cheese and milk, but nothing more. Among
the Mohammedans sheep are sacrificed on certain days as a
festive and at the same time a religious ceremony; these ceremonies
are of great antiquity and derived from Arab heathenism.
On the pilgrimage to Mecca every one is required to sacrifice
a sheep at a certain place near Mecca<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>By the Law of Moses the sheep was a <i>clean</i> animal, and
might consequently be eaten or sacrificed. A lamb or kid,
roasted whole, was the principal and characteristic dish at the
feast of the passover. The rich man kills a lamb to entertain
his guest in the beautiful parable of Nathan. (2 <i>Sam.</i> xii. 4.)
Sheep were killed on the festive occasion of shearing the very
numerous flocks of Nabal. (1 <i>Sam.</i> xxv. 2. 11. 18.) An ox
and six choice sheep were sacrificed daily for the numerous
guests of Nehemiah, while he was building the wall of Jerusalem.
(<i>Neh.</i> v. 17, 18.) Immense numbers of sheep and oxen
were sacrificed at the dedication of Solomon’s temple. (1 <i>Kings</i>,
viii. 5. 63.) The prophet Ezekiel (xxxiv. 3.) describes the bad
shepherd as selfishly eating the flesh and clothing himself with
the wool of the sheep, without tending them with due care and
labor.</p>

<p>In the Suovetaurilia among the Romans a hog, a sheep, and
a bull, their principal domestic animals, were sacrificed. A
sheep was killed every day for the guards, who watched the
tomb of Cyrus. (<i>Arrian</i>, <i>vol.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 438, <i>Blancardi</i>.) In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
Odyssey (ρ. 180-182.) a sacrifice is made and a feast prepared
of sheep, goats, hogs, and a cow. Also in Od. v. 3. 250. sheep
are sacrificed and furnish part of a feast. In order to ratify a
treaty between the Greeks and Trojans, the former sacrificed a
lamb of the male sex to Jupiter; the latter one of the male
sex and white to the Sun, and another of the female sex and
black to the Earth. (Il. γ. 103, 104.) Sheep are sacrificed to
Apollo at Delphi in Euripides, Ion, <i>l.</i> 230. 380. The rare instances
of the use of sheep for food or sacrifice by the Egyptians
have been already noticed.</p>

<p>But, although sheep, both old and young, male and female,
were sacrificed to the objects of religious worship and on other
festive occasions were eaten, especially by the rich and great,
yet their chief use was to supply clothing, and the nourishment
they yielded consisted in their milk and the cheese made from
it, rather than in their flesh.</p>

<p>This fact is illustrated by the words of Solomon, formerly
quoted, and in which he speaks of lambs for <i>clothing</i> and
goat’s <i>milk</i> for food. In like manner St. Paul says (1 Cor. ix.
7.), “Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit
thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of
the flock?”</p>

<p>Varro thinks, that sheep were employed for the use of man <i>before
any other animal</i> on account of their usefulness and placidity,
and he represents their use to consist in supplying cheese and
milk for food, fleeces and skins for clothing<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. In like manner
Columella in his account of the use of sheep (vii. 2.) says, they afforded
the chief materials for clothing. In treating of their use
for food, he mentions only their milk and cheese. Pliny refers
to the employment of sheep both for sacrifices and for clothing.
He also remarks, that as the ox is principally useful in obtaining
food, to wit, by ploughing and other agricultural processes,
the sheep, on the other hand, supplies materials for clothing<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>

<p>The fact, that wool was among the ancients by far the most
common material for making clothes, accounts for the various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
expressions in scripture respecting the destructiveness of the
moth.</p>

<p>“Your garments are moth-eaten.” James v. 2. “He, as a
rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten.”&mdash;Job
xiii. 28. “They all shall wax old as a garment, the moth
shall eat them up.”&mdash;Is. l. 9. “The moth shall eat them up
like a garment, and the worms shall eat them like wool.” Is.
li. 8. “From garments cometh a moth.” Eccles. xlii. 13.
“Treasures, where moth and rust corrupt.” Matt. vi. 19.</p>

<p>But it is to be observed, that the sacred writers mention not
the moth, but the minute worm, which changes into a moth,
and which alone gnaws the garments. In the passages which
have been quoted, the word “moth” must be understood to signify
the larva<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> of the clothes-moth (<i>Phalæna Vestianella</i>,
Linn.), or of some insect of the same kind.</p>

<p>The inquiry into the origin and propagation of the Goat, no
less than that of the sheep, may justly be considered a subject
for interesting investigation. Goats were no less highly prized
by the ancient inhabitants of Greece and Italy than by the
modern. We have seen, that the great value of sheep always
consisted in its fleece. The goat, on the contrary, was more
valued for the excellence and abundance of its milk, and for its
suitableness to higher and more rugged and unproductive land
<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="Footnote_368" href="#FNanchor_368" class="label">[368]</a> Virgil, Georg. iii. 305-321.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We observe a clear allusion to this distinction between the
principal uses of sheep and of goats in the twenty-seventh
chapter of the book of Proverbs<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. The management and use
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
of goats has from time immemorial formed a striking feature in
the condition of man, and especially of those nations which belong
to the Caucasian, or, as Dr. Prichard more properly denominates
it, the <i>Iranian</i> or <i>Indo-Atlantic</i> variety of our race
<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>.
Their habits of sheep-breeding seem no less characteristic than
the form of their countenances, a no less essential part of their
manner of life than any other custom, by which they are distinguished:
and, as all the circumstances, which throw any
light upon the question, conspire to render it probable, that the
above-mentioned variety of the human race first inhabited part
of the high land of central Asia, so it is remarkable, that our
domestic sheep and goats may with the greatest probability be
referred to the same stock with certain wild animals, which
now overspread those regions. The sheep, as has been already
observed in chapter I., is regarded as specifically the same with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
the Argali; and in the opinion of Pallas, which has been very
generally adopted by zoologists, the goat is the same with the
Ægagrus, a gregarious quadruped, which occupies the loftiest
parts of the mountains extending from the Caucasus to the
South of the Caspian Sea, and thence to the North of India
<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>.
Indeed the history of these animals is so interwoven with the
history of man, that those naturalists have not reasoned quite
correctly, who have thought it necessary to refer the first origin
of either of them to any wild stock at all. They assume, that
these quadrupeds first existed in an undomesticated state, that
is, entirely apart from man and independent of him; that, as
he advanced in civilization, as his wants multiplied, and he became
more ingenious and active in inventing methods of supplying
them, the thought struck him, that he might obtain
from these wild beasts the materials of his food and clothing;
and that he therefore caught and confined some of them and
in the course of time rendered them by cultivation more and
more suitable to his purposes.</p>

“Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.
The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of thy field; and thou
shalt have goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for

<p>Bochart has quoted a great variety of ancient testimonies to the value of goats’-milk
in his Hierozoicon, l. ii. cap. 51. pp. 629, 630. ed. Leusden.</p>

<i>oval</i> form of the skull. Their distribution over the face of the earth may be seen
in the Map, <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a></p>

<p>The only remarkable exception to this limitation of ancient sheep-breeding, is
the case of the Chinese. It would appear from the following evidence, that they
had both sheep and goats in ancient times.</p>

<p>The Chinese character for a sacrifice is a compound of two characters, one
placed above the other; the upper one, <i>Yang</i>, is the character for <i>a lamb</i>, the
lower is the character for <i>fire</i>; so that <i>a lamb on the fire</i> denotes <i>a sacrifice</i>. See
Morison’s Chinese Dictionary, vol. iii. part i.</p>

<p>According to the mythology of the Chinese, which as well as their written
characters is of high antiquity, one of the four rivers, which rise in Mount Kaen-lun
and run towards the four quarters of the globe, is called the Yang-Choui, i. e.
the <i>Lamb-River</i>. Thomas Stephens Davies, Esq. in Dr. Robert Thomson’s British
Annual for 1837, p. 271, 277.</p>

<p>Yang-Ching, i. e. <i>Sheep-city</i>, was an ancient name of Canton. Morison, p.
55. There is a character for the <i>Goat</i>, which means the <i>Yang of the mountains</i>,
Yang being a general term like the Hebrew צאן, including both sheep and
goats. Ib. p. 61, 62.</p>

<p>In the following passage of Rufus Festus Avienus, who flourished about A. D.
400, we have a distinct testimony, that the ancient Seres, the probable ancestors
of the Chinese, employed themselves in the care of sheep at the same time that
they were devoted to the production of silk.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>We have no reason to assume, that man and the two lesser
kinds of horned cattle were originally independent of one another.
So far as geology supplies any evidence, it is in favor
of the supposition, that these quadrupeds and man belong to
the same epoch. No properly fossil bones either of the sheep or
goat have yet been found, and we have no reason to believe,
that these animals were produced until the creation of man.
But, as we must suppose, that man was created perfect and
full-grown, and with those means of subsistence around him,
which his nature and constitution require, there is no reason
why the sheep and the goat may not have been created in such
a state as to be adapted immediately both for clothing and for
food, or why it should be considered more probable that they
were at first entirely wild. They may have been produced
originally in the same abode, which was occupied by that variety
of the human race, to whose habits and mode of life the
use of them has always been so essential; and, if we assume,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
that this abode was somewhere in the elevated land of central
Asia, in the region, for example, of Armenia, we adopt an hypothesis,
which explains in the most simple and satisfactory
manner the apparent fact of the propagation not only of men,
but of these quadrupeds with them, from that centre over immense
regions of the globe.</p>

<p>With regard to historical evidence, it is certainly very defective.
No express testimony assures us of the facts included in
the above-named hypothesis. One thing, however, is certain,
and it appears very deserving of attention, viz. that the sheep
and the goat have <i>always</i> been propagated together. We find
great nations, which had no acquaintance with either of these
quadrupeds, but depended for their subsistence upon either
oxen or horses. We find others, on the contrary, to whose
mode of life the larger quadrupeds were of much less importance
than the smaller; but we find none, which were accustomed
to breed sheep without goats, or goats without sheep.</p>

<p>The reader will find numerous illustrations of this fact on
reviewing the evidence contained in the preceding chapters.
General terms were employed in the ancient world to include
both sheep and goats<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. Where more specific terms are used,
we still find “rams and goats,” “ewes and she-goats” mentioned
together. Sheep and goats were offered together in sacrifice,
and the instances are too numerous to mention, in which the
same flock, or the wealth of a single individual, included both
these animals.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_372" href="#FNanchor_372" class="label">[372]</a> It should be observed, that the Hebrew word translated <i>sheep</i> in Ex. ix. 3.

<p>In consequence of this prevailing association of sheep and
goats, they are often represented together in ancient bas-reliefs
and other works of art. Of this we have a beautiful example
in the Rev. Robert Walpole’s collection of “Travels in various
countries of the East.” At the end of the volume is a plate
taken from a votive tablet of Pentelic marble dedicated to Pan,
and representing five goats, two sheep, and a lamb. As the
goats are in one group, and the sheep and lamb in another, the
artist probably designed to represent a flock of each. For,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
though sometimes mixed in the same flock, the two kinds of
animals were generally kept apart; and to this circumstance
our Savior alludes in his image of the shepherd dividing the
sheep from the goats<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>.</p>

<p>In the account given in chapter II. of the Sicilian Daphnis, an

<p>Theocritus (<i>Idyll.</i> vii. 12-20.) describes a goatherd of Cydon
in Crete, named Lycidas; and from the account which he
gives of his attire, we may judge of that commonly used in
ancient Greece by the same description of persons. He wore
on his shoulders the dun-colored hide of a shaggy goat, and an
old shawl was fastened about his breast with a broad girdle.
In his right hand he held a crook of wild olive.</p>

<p>The same author (<i>Idyll.</i> iii. 5.) mentions a fine strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
he-goat, which was brought from Lybia to Sicily. The design
of its transportation was, no doubt, to improve the breed.
Probably Chromis, the Lybian (<i>Idyll.</i> i. 24.), who resided in
Sicily, had migrated there to undertake the management of
goats and to improve their quality.</p>

<p>Maximus Tyrius (<i>Diss.</i> xxvii.) seems to suppose, that a
flock of goats could not even exist without the music of the
syrinx. “If you take away,” says he, “the goatherd and his
syrinx, you dissolve the flock of goats; in like manner, if you
take away reason from the society of men, thus depriving them
of their leader and guide, you destroy the flock, which by nature
is tame, but may be injured by a bad superintendence.”</p>

<p>The he-goat was employed to lead the flock as the ram was
among sheep. The following passages of scripture allude to
this custom. “Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go
forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats
before the flocks.” <i>Jer.</i> l. 8. “Mine anger was kindled against
the shepherds, and I punished the goats.” <i>Zech.</i> x. 3. In
Proverbs xxx. 31., according to the Septuagint version, we read
of “the goat which leads the flock.” Julius Pollux (Lib. i. <i>cap.</i>
12. <i>sect.</i> 19.) says, that “The he-goat leads the goats<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>.”</p>

<p>On a cameo in the Florentine Museum there is a representation
of an ancient goatherd<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. The goatherd holds the syrinx
in his left hand, and a young kid in his right. A goat stands
beside him, and his dog appears partially concealed within a
kennel formed in the rock, upon which the goatherd is seated.
The herdsman is represented sitting under an aged ilex. At
least this supposition accords with the language of Tibullus already
quoted.</p>

<p>A modern authoress, who spent some of the summer months
in the year 1819 among the mountains east of Rome, notices
goats in the following terms as part of the stock of the farmers
in that country.</p>

<p>“We frequently walked to one of these little farms, to meet
the goats coming in at night from the mountain. As the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
flock crowded down the broken road leading to the fold, followed
by their grotesque-looking shepherd and his rough dogs, <i>the
pet-kids crowding round their master and answering to his
call</i>, we could not help thinking of the antique manners described
by the poets, and represented in the pictures of Herculaneum
and Pompeii.</p>

<p>“The goats are the most useful domestic animals. Here no
other cheese or milk is tasted. Besides, the ricotta, a kind of
curd, and junkets, are made of goats’-milk, and, with bread
serve many of the country people for food<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.”</p>

on to show their contributions to the <i>weaver</i>.</p>

<p>The last line of this passage of Virgil is quoted by Columella
(L. vii. 6.) in speaking of the utility of the he-goat;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For he himself is shorn “for the use of camps and to make coverings for
wretched sailors.”</p>
</div>

<p>Virgil, moreover, has here followed Varro, who writes thus;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the sheep yields to man wool for clothing, so the goat furnishes hair for the
use of sailors, and to make ropes for military engines, and vessels for artificers.
* * * * * The goats are shorn in a great part of Phrygia, because there
they have long shaggy hair. Cilicia (i. e. hair-cloths), and other things of the
same kind, are commonly imported from that country. The name <i>Cilicia</i> is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
said to be derived from the circumstance, that in Cilicia goats were first shorn
for this purpose. <i>De Re Rustica</i>, L. ii. <i>c.</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 201. <i>ed. Bip.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The language of Varro in this passage indicates, that the female
goat was shorn as well as the male; and that the excellence
of goats’-hair, which was used only for coarse articles,
consisted in its length. Columella mentions the long bristly
hair of the Cilician goats<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

<p>Aristotle says, “In Lycia goats are shorn, as sheep are in
other countries.” <i>Hist. Anim.</i> viii. 28. This testimony of
Aristotle agrees with that of his nephew and pupil, Callisthenes,
who says (<i>ap. Ælian. de Nat. Anim.</i> xvi. 30.), “that in Lycia
goats are shorn just as sheep are everywhere else; for that they
have a very thick coat of excellent hair, hanging from them in
locks or curls; and that this hair is twisted so as to make ropes,
which are used in navigation instead of cables.”</p>

<p>Pliny, in his account of goats<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>, says, “In Cilicia and about
the Syrtes they are covered with hair, which admits of being
shorn.” From this it may be inferred, in conformity with the
testimonies already cited from Varro and Virgil, that the longest
and best goats’-hair was obtained in Cilicia, and on the coast
of Africa opposite to Sicily and Malta, the modern Tripoli. It
is remarkable, that Virgil, in order to designate the latter district,
refers to the romantic river Cinyps, which flowed through
it, observing the same practice, which we have seen to be so
common with the poets in regard to the countries noted for the
produce of the most excellent wool. In the interior and more
hilly portion of this district of Africa both sheep and goats are
still reared<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>.</p>

<p>The geographer Avienus asserts that goats’-hair was obtained
for the purpose of being <i>woven</i> in the country of the Cynetæ
in Spain<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>. Isidore of Seville, in his enumeration of the different
kinds of cloth (<i>Orig.</i> xix. 22.), uses the following expressions:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
“Fibrini (vestis est) tramam de fibri lanâ habens: caprina.”
Thus the text now stands, evidently defective. The
writer no doubt alluded to a kind of cloth called <i>caprina</i>, because
goats’-hair was used in the manufacture of it. Beckmann
(<i>History of Inventions</i>, <i>Eng. Trans.</i>, <i>vol.</i> iv. <i>p.</i> 224.) proposes
to read, “tramam de fibri lanâ habens, stamen de caprinâ,” i. e.
“having the woof of beaver-wool, the warp of goats’-wool.” But
the ancients were unacquainted with the fine wool of certain
goats, and it is highly improbable, that they used goats’-<i>hair</i>
in the case referred to, since the “Vestes Fibrinæ” were of great
value, as will soon be shown, and not made in any part of coarse
materials.</p>

<p>The cloth of goats’-hair would be suitable for sailors, both on
account of their hardy mode of life, and because it was better
adapted than any other kind to bear exposure to water.</p>

<p>Its use as clothing to express mourning and mortification
will be noticed presently.</p>

<p>The employment of goats’-hair for military and naval purposes
was far more extensive, and is proved by the following
passage from the Geoponica (xviii. 9.) in addition to the former
testimonies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Προσοδόυς δίδωσιν οὐκ ὀλίγας, τὰς ἀπὸ γάλακτος καὶ τύρου καὶ (σἀρκός)· πρὸς δὲ τούτοις

<p>The goat yields no small profit from its milk, cheese, and (flesh). It also yields
a profit from its hair, which is necessary for making ropes, sacks, and similar articles,
and for nautical purposes, since it is not easily cut, and does not rot from
natural causes, unless it be much neglected.&mdash;<i>Yates’s Translation.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Cicero (<i>in Verrem</i>, <i>Act</i> i.) mentions <i>Cilicia</i> together with
hides and sacks, and Asconius Pedianus in his Commentary
on the passage (<i>p.</i> 95. <i>ed. Crenii.</i>) gives the following explanation:
“Cilicia texta de pilis in castrorum usum atque nautarum.”
Servius on Virgil, Georg. iii. 313. says, that these Cilicia,
or cloths of goats’-hair, were used to cover the towers in
sieges, because they could not be set on fire.</p>

<p>The reader is referred to the Poliorcetica of Lipsius, L. iii.
Dial. 3. p. 158. for evidence respecting the use of hair ropes for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
military engines, and to L. v. Dial. ix. for passages from Thucydides,
Arrian, Ammianus, Suidas, Vegetius, Curtius, and
others, proving, that the besieged in cities hung Cilicia over
their towers and walls to obviate the force of the various weapons
hurled against them, and especially of the arrows, which
carried fire.</p>

<p>From Exodus we learn<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>, that the Israelites in the wilderness
among their contributions to the Tabernacle gave goats’-hair,
and that it was spun by women. The spun goats’-hair was
probably used in part to make cords for the tent; but part
of it at least was <i>woven</i> into the large pieces, called in the Septuagint
“curtains of goats’-hair.” Such curtains, or <i>Saga</i>, of
spun goats’-hair seem to have been commonly used for the covering
of tents<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>.</p>

and <span class="smcap">Saccus</span> in the Vulgate version of the Scriptures. The

<p>This kind of cloth, which was black or dark brown, the goats
of Syria and Palestine being chiefly of that color even to the
present day, is alluded to in the sixth chapter of Revelations<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>,
and in Is. l. 3. “I clothe the heavens with blackness and make
sack-cloth their covering.” It was worn to express mourning
and mortification. In Jonah we have a very remarkable case,
for on this occasion blankets of goats’-hair were put on the
bodies both of men and beasts, and one was worn even by the
king of Nineveh himself<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>. When Herod Agrippa was seized
at Cæsarea with the mortal distemper mentioned in Acts xii.
(See <a href="#Page_93">chap. vi. p. 93.</a>), the common people sat down on hair-cloth
according to the custom of their country, beseeching God
on his behalf.&mdash;<i>Josephus</i>, <i>Ant. Jud.</i> <i>l.</i> xix. <i>cap.</i> 8. <i>p.</i> 872.
<i>Hudson</i>. So according to Josephus (<i>Ant. Jud.</i> <i>l.</i> vii. <i>cap.</i> 7.
<i>p.</i> 299.), David fell down upon sack-cloth of the same description
and lay on the ground praying for the restoration of his
son.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_388" href="#FNanchor_388" class="label">[388]</a> “So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on

unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from

v. 5. we should translate “put on hair-cloths;” for the word is <i>plural</i> in the Hebrew.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Hence the use of the hair-shirt by devotees in more recent
times. St. Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea in the fourth century, in
answer to the question, Whether a monk ought to have besides
his night-shirt (<i>post nocturnam tunicam</i>) a Cilicium or any
other, says, “Cilicii quidem usus habet proprium tempus. Non
enim propter usus corporis, sed propter afflictionem carnis inventum
est hujuscemodi indumentum, et propter humilitatem animae<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>.”
He then adds, that as the word of God forbids us to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
have two shirts, we ought not to have a second except for the
purpose here mentioned. From this it is clear, that the Cilicium
was not commonly worn by the monks, but only at particular
times for the sake of humiliation.</p>

which a considerable quantity is exported. In modern as in

<p>The goat, as is the case with some other quadrupeds, if confined
to a country, which is hot in summer and very cold in
winter, is always protected in the latter season by an additional
covering of fine wool beneath its long hair. A specimen of the
Syrian goat in the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow shows both
the hair and the wool. In Kerman and Cashmere this very
fine wool is obtained by combing the goats in the spring, when
it becomes loose; and, having been spun into yarn, it is used to
make the beautiful <i>shawls</i> brought from those countries.</p>

<p>We will now conclude this chapter with the following interesting
communication from Mr. E. Riley, being the substance
of a paper lately read before the Society of Arts, London.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley “in 1825 and 1828 transported to that territory
two flocks of the finest sheep procurable throughout Germany,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
my father had also long contemplated introducing there the
celebrated Cashmere goat, anticipating that the fulfilment of
his views would, in proving advantageous to himself, become
also of ultimate benefit to the colony; in which expectation, he
has been encouraged from the results that have attended the
importation of the Saxon breed of sheep into their favored climates,
the wools of New South Wales, and in proportion to
their improvement, those also of Van Dieman’s Land being
now eagerly purchased by the most intelligent manufacturers
in preference to those of equal prices imported from any part of
Europe.</p>

<p>“With this object in view, he subsequently, during an agricultural
tour on the Continent, directed my attention to the Cashmere
flocks of Mons. Ternaux, and in October 1828, I met this
distinguished man at his seat at St. Onen (Mons. Ternaux is
a great shawl manufacturer and a Peer of France,) where he
preserved the elite of his herds; the animals were a mixture of
various sizes and colors, from a perfect white to brown, with
scarcely any stamped features as if belonging to one race exclusively;
they were covered with long coarse hair, under which
so small a quantity of soft short down was concealed, that the
average produce of the whole collection did not exceed three
ounces each; therefore, under these unfavorable circumstances,
my father deferred for a time his intention of sending any of
them to Australia.</p>

<p>“I was then advised by the Viscomte Perrault de Jotemps,
to see the stock of M. Polonceau at Versailles, he having, by a
happily selected cross, succeeded in increasing the quantity and
value of the qualities of the Cashmere goat beyond the most sanguine
anticipations, and in consequence of his enlightened taste
for agricultural pursuits, was also honored with the directorship
of the model farm at Grignon. He became among the first to
purchase a chosen selection of the original importation of the
Cashmere goat from M. Ternaux, and some time after seeing,
at one of the estates of the Duchesse de Beri, an Angora buck
with an extraordinary silkiness of hair, having more the character
of long coarse but very soft down, he solicited permission
to try the effects of a union with this fine animal and his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
pure Cashmeres. The improvement even in the first drop was
so rapid that it induced him to persevere, and when I first saw
his small herd they were in the third generation from the males
produced solely by the first cross; the unwillingness however
of M. Polonceau to part with any number of them at this period
(the only alienation he has made from the favorite products
of his solicitude being two males and two females to the <i>King</i>
of <i>Wirtemberg</i>, for the sum of 3400 francs,) caused my father
again to postpone his intentions until my return from the Australasian
Colonies, judging that M. Polonceau would then probably
be enabled to dispose of a sufficient number, and that the
constancy and properties of the race would by that time be
more decidedly determined.</p>

<p>“On my arrival in England at the close of 1831, he again
recurred to his favorite project of introducing these animals into
our colonies, for which purpose I went to France with the intention
of purchasing a small flock of M. Polonceau, should I
find all his expectations of the Cashmere Angora breed verified,
which having perfectly ascertained, I at length succeeded in
persuading M. Polonceau to cede to me ten females in kid, and
three males, and I fortunately was able to convey the whole in
health to London, with the intention of proceeding as speedily as
possible with them to Port Jackson, looking sanguinely forward
not only to their rapid increase but also to <i>crossing</i> the <i>common
goats</i> of the country with this valuable breed, in full expectation
that they may, exclusive of their own pure down, become
thus the means of forming a desirable addition to the already
much prized importations from New South Wales and Van
Dieman’s Land. I am led to the conclusion that the latter result
may be accomplished, as M. Polonceau, who has tried the
experiment with the native goat of France, has obtained animals
of the second cross very little inferior to the breed that has
rendered his name so distinguished. He has also crossed the
common goat with the pure Cashmere, but only obtained so
tardy an amelioration, that it required eight or ten generations
to produce a down simply equal to their inferior quantity and
quality when compared to the produce of the Cashmere Angora.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
Mr. Polonceau has unremittingly persevered in the improvement
so immediately effected, and has proved during the several
years which have elapsed since the first experiment in the
year 1822, that an entire satisfactory result in the union of the
most essential qualities of down, <i>abundance</i>, <i>length</i>, <i>fineness</i>,
<i>lustre</i>, and <i>softness</i>, was accomplished by the first cross, without
any return having ensued to the individual characters of
either of the primitive races, and in consequence, he has since
constantly propagated the produce of that cross among themselves,
careful only of preserving animals entirely white and of
employing for propagation those bucks which had the down in
the greatest quantity and of the finest quality with the smallest
proportion of hair.</p>

<p>In 1826; the “Societie Royale et Centrale d’Agriculture de
Paris” acquainted with the interesting result of M. Polonceau’s
flock, being at that time in the third generation, and considering
that the down of this new race was <i>more valuable than that
of the East</i>, and that it was the most beautiful of filaceous
materials known, as it combines the softness of Cashmere with
the lustre of silk, awarded him their large gold medal at their
session, 4th April, 1826, and nominated him a member of their
society in the following year.</p>

<p>In 1827, at the exhibition of the produce of National Industry,
the jury appointed to judge the merits of the objects exposed,
also awarded him their medal.</p>

<p>At present the animals are in the twelfth generation, their
health and vigor, the constancy of their qualities, and abundance
of their down <i>without any degeneration</i>, prove that this
new race may be regarded as one entirely fixed and established,
requiring solely the care that is generally observed with valuable
breeds; that is to say, a judicious choice of those employed
for their reproduction, and in such a climate as New South
Wales it may be reasonably expected that the brilliant qualities
of their down may yet be improved as has been so eminently
the case with the wool of the merino and Saxon sheep imported
there.</p>

<p>M. Polonceau has goats that have yielded as many as thirty
ounces of the down, in one season, and he states that the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
of his herd produce from twelve to twenty ounces; thus showing
the astonishing advantages this new breed has <i>over the
uncrossed Cashmere</i>, which never yield more than four ounces
and seldom exceed two ounces each.</p>

<p>This gentleman also states, that, the Cashmere Angora goats,
are more robust and more easily nourished than the common
goat, and that they are less capricious and more easily managed
in a flock; and from the experience he has already had, he
finds them much more docile than even sheep. They prefer
the leaves of trees, as do all other goats, but they thrive either
on hay or straw, or green fodder, or in meadows; they also
feed with equal facility on heaths, and on the most abrupt declivities,
where the sheep would perish; they do not fear the
cold, and are allowed to remain all the winter in open sheds.
For the first year or two of M. P.’s experiments he thought it
prudent to give them aromatic herbs, from time to time, but
during the last six years he has not found it necessary. He
knows not of any particular disease to which they are subject,
his flock never having had any. M. P. arranges they should
kid in March, but occasionally he takes <i>two</i> falls from those of
sufficient strength during the year.</p>

<p>The down commences to grow in September, and developes
itself progressively until the end of March, when it ceases to
grow and detaches itself, unless artificially removed.</p>

<p>To collect the down, he waits the period when it begins to
detach itself, and then the locks of down which separate from
the skin with little force are taken off by hand; the down is
removed from the animals every three or four days; in general
it first begins to fall from the neck and shoulders, and in the
following four or five days from the rest of the body; the collection
is completed in the space of eight or ten days. Sometimes
the entire down can be taken from the animal at one
shearing, and almost in an unbroken fleece, when it begins to
loosen. The shearing has the advantage of preserving more
perfectly the parallelisms of the individual filaments, which
much increase the facility of combing and preparing the down
for manufacturing purposes.</p>

</div>

<p class="hanging2">The passage quoted from Isidore of Seville, in the last chapter,
shows that the ancients made a cloth, the woof of which
was of Beavers’-wool (<i>de fibri lanâ</i>), and which was therefore
called <i>Vestis Fibrina</i>. By <i>lana</i> he must have meant the
very fine wool, which, agreeably to the observation in the last
paragraph, grows under the long hair of the beaver. Isidore in
the same Book, observes, “Fibrinum lana est animalium, quæ
fibros vocant: ipsos et castores existimant.”</p>

<p>The following Epigram of Claudian seems intended, as
Beckmann (iv. <i>p.</i> 223.) supposes, to describe “a worn-out
beaver dress, which had nothing more left of that valuable fur
but the name.”</p>

<h4>ON A BEAVER MANTLE.</h4>

<p>Gerbert, or Gilbert, surnamed the Philosopher, and afterwards
Pope Silvester II., commenting on the qualities of a good
Bishop according to 1 Timothy iii. 1., says in reference to the
word “ornatum:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Quod si juxta sensum literæ tantûm respiciamus, non aliud, sacerdotes, quam

“An upper garment of this cloth was worn by the Emperor
Nicephorus II. at his coronation in the year 936.”&mdash;<i>Beckmann</i>,
<i>l. c.</i> § 31.</p>

<p>“This method of manufacturing beavers’-hair,” observes
Beckmann, “seems not to have been known in the time of
Pliny; for, though he speaks much of the <i>castor</i>, and mentions
<i>pellis fibrina</i> three times, he says nothing in regard to manufacturing
the hair, or to beaver-fur.”</p>

<p>It seems probable, that the Greeks and Romans did not use
cloth of beavers’-wool until the 4th century. In an earlier age
the furs and drugs supplied by beavers were obtained from the
countries to the North of the Euxine Sea. But in the period
now under consideration the intercourse of the Romans with the
West of Europe would open a much more extended sphere for
procuring the Vestes Fibrinæ, since we have traces of the existence
of beavers in almost all parts of Europe. Their appearance
in Wales, Scotland, Germany, and the North of Europe
generally, is attested by Giraldus Cambrensis<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>.</p>

<p>Buffon says (<i>Hist. Nat.</i> <i>tome</i> 26. <i>p.</i> 98.), “There are beavers
in Languedoc in the islands of the Rhone, and great numbers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
of them in the North of Europe.” “But as human population
extends,” he observes, “beavers, like other animals, are
dispersed, become solitary, fugitive, or conceal themselves in the
ground: they cease to unite in bands, to engage in building or
other undertakings.”</p>

<p>“We have been unable to ascertain,” says Cuvier<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>, “after the
most scrupulous comparisons, if the Castors or Beavers, which
burrow along the Rhone, the Danube, and the Weser, are different
in species from those of North America, or if they are
prevented from building by the vicinity of man.” The same
distinguished author in his work on Fossil Bones says, “The
greater part of our European rivers having formerly supported
beavers, and some of them doing so still, viz. the Gardon and
the Rhone in France, the Danube in Bavaria and Austria, and
several small rivers in Westphalia and Saxony, we cannot be
surprised to find their hones preserved in our mosses, or turbaries.”
He then mentions instances of the heads and teeth of
beavers, in the valley of the Somme in Picardy, in the valley of
Tonnis-stein near Andermach, and at Urdingen on the Rhine
in Rhenish Prussia<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.</p>

<p>We are informed by Ctesias, in a fragment of the 10th Book

<p>“This hair, Sir J. Chardin tells us (in his MS. note on 1

sheep, but they pull off this woolly hair, which the camels are
disposed to cast off; as many other creatures, it is well known,

<p>Campbell, the poet, mentions a tent of camels’-hair cloth,
which he saw at an Arab encampment between Oran and Mascara
in the kingdom of Algiers. It was 25 feet in diameter
and very lofty. (<i>Letters from the South</i>, 1837, <i>vol.</i> ii. <i>p.</i>

Berbers, who live in the vicinity of Algiers, and are descended
from the original occupants of the country, dwell in “tents of
camels’-hair.” We are informed that the Chinese make <i>carpets</i>

<p>Fortunatus, in his life of St. Martin (l. iv.), describes a garment
of such cloth; but it may be doubted whether he took
his description from actual knowledge of the use of it, or only
from the account in Matthew of the dress of John the Baptist
already quoted.</p>

<p>Camels’-hair of annual growth would vary in fineness according
to circumstances, and might be used either for the
coarse raiment of prophets and dervises, <i>or for the costly
shawls</i>, to which Ctesias alludes. Fine wool, adapted to the
latter purpose, might also grow, as in the goat and beaver, beneath
the long hair of the camel. It has been doubted
whether cloth so fine and beautiful as Ctesias asserts, could possibly
be obtained from camels. The following accounts by
modern travellers illustrate and justify the statement of the
suspected ancient.</p>

<p>Marco Polo, who travelled in the 13th century, in his account
of the city of Kalaka, which was in the province of Tangut
and subject to the Great Kahn, says<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>, “In this city they manufacture
beautiful camelots, the finest known in the world, of the
hair of camels and likewise of fine wool.” According to Pallas,
(Travels, vol. ii. § 8.,) “From the hair of the camel the Tartar
women in the plains of the Crimea manufacture a narrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
cloth, which is used in its natural color, and is extremely warm,
soft, and light.” According to Prosper Alpinus, (<i>Hist. Nat.
Ægypti</i>, <i>l.</i> iv. <i>c.</i> 7. <i>p.</i> 225.) the Egyptians manufactured from
the hair of their camels not only coarse cloth for their tents,
but other kinds so fine as to be worn not only by princes but
even by the senators of Venice.</p>

<p>Elphinstone, in his account of Cabul (<i>p.</i> 295.), mentions,
that “Oormuck, a fine cloth made of camels’-wool,” is among
the articles imported into Cabul from the Bokhara country.
This country lies North of the Oxus, and East of the Southern
extremity of the Caspian Sea, and is probably the country, to
which Ctesias more especially referred. A still more recent authority
is that of Moorcroft, who informs us, that “Cloth is now
made from the wool of the wild camels of Khoten in Chinese
Tartary,” and that “at Astrakhan a fine cloth is manufactured
from the wool of the camel foal of the first year<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>.”</p>

<p>It is customary in many parts of the East, as it was in Mexico in the time of
Cortes (See <a href="#Chapter3_I">Part Third, Chapter I</a>.) to use the hair of various animals in embroidering
garments. The Candian women even embroider with their own hair,
as well as that of animals, with which they make splendid representations of
flowers, foliage, &amp;c.: they also insert the skins of eels and serpents.</p>

<p>According to M. de Busson, the negresses of Senegal, embroider the skins of
various beasts, representing figures, flowers, and animals, in every variety of
color.</p>

<p>Among all the materials which the skill of man converts into
comfortable and elegant clothing, that which appears likely to
be the most extensively useful, though it was the last to be
generally diffused, is the beautiful produce of the cotton-plant.</p>

<p>The properties of cotton strongly recommend it for clothing,
especially in comparison with linen, both in hot and cold countries.
Linen has, indeed, in some respects the advantage; it
forms a smooth, firm, and beautiful cloth, and is very agreeable
wear in temperate climates; but it is less comfortable than cotton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
and less conducive to health, either in heat or in cold.
Cotton, being a bad conductor of heat, as compared with linen,
preserves the body at a more equable temperature. The functions
of the skin, through the medium of perspiration, are the
great means of maintaining the body at an equable temperature
amidst the vicissitudes of the atmosphere. But linen,
like all good conductors of heat, freely condenses the vapor of
perspiration, and accumulates moisture upon the skin: the
wetted linen becomes cold, chills the body, and checks perspiration,
thus not only producing discomfort, but endangering
health. Calico, on the other hand, like all bad conductors of
heat, condenses little of the perspiration, but allows it to pass
off in the form of vapor. Moreover, when the perspiration is
so copious as to accumulate moisture, calico will absorb a greater
quantity of that moisture than linen. It has therefore a
double advantage,&mdash;it accumulates less moisture, and absorbs
more.</p>

<p>From the above considerations, it is evident that in cold climates,
or in the nocturnal cold of tropical climates, cotton
clothing is much better calculated to preserve the warmth of
the body than linen. In hot climates, also, it is more conducive
to health and comfort, by admitting of freer perspiration<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_410" href="#FNanchor_410" class="label">[410]</a> Bains’s “History of the Cotton Manufacture,” p. 12.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wool, as we have seen, was principally used for weaving in
Palestine and Syria, in Asia Minor, Greece, Italy and Spain;
hemp in the Northern countries of Europe; flax in Egypt
(The history of the two last, hemp and flax, is given in Part
IV. to which the reader is referred.); silk in the central regions
of Asia<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. In like manner cotton has <i>always</i> been characteristic
of India. We find this circumstance distinctly noticed
by Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. Among the valuable products, for which India
was remarkable, he states, that “the wild trees in that country
bear fleeces as their fruit, surpassing those of sheep in beauty
and excellence; and the Indians use cloth made from these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
trees.” In the same book (c. 47.) Herodotus says, that the thorax
or cuirass sent by Amasis, king of Egypt, to Sparta, was
“adorned with gold and with fleeces from trees.” These substances
were perhaps used in the weft to form the figures (ζῶα),
which were woven into the thorax; but it appears equally
probable that the gold only was thus employed, the cotton
being used as an inside lining or stuffing: and in this case it is
possible, that the down of the Bombax Ceiba, a tree allied to
the Cotton-plant (<i>Gossypium</i>), may have been used, since,
though not fitted for spinning or weaving, it has long been used
in India for the stuffing of pillows and similar purposes, and
would be included under the phrase employed by Herodotus,
“<i>wool</i>” or “<i>fleeces from trees</i>.” The thorax may have been
made in Egypt; but the materials, used to enrich it, were probably
imported: for we have no proof, that either gold or cotton
of any kind was found in that country as a native product in
the time of Amasis.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_412" href="#FNanchor_412" class="label">[412]</a> L. iii. c. 106.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ctesias, the contemporary of Herodotus, seems also to have
known the fact of the use of a kind of wool, the produce of
trees, for spinning and weaving among the Indians. It is evident
that Ctesias referred exclusively to cotton cloths, as may
be inferred from the testimony of Varro, as we find it in Servius
(<i>Comm. in Virgilii Æn.</i> i. 649.). “Ctesias ait in Indiâ esse
arbores, quæ lanam ferant.”</p>

<p>The expedition of Alexander the Great into India contributed
to make the Greeks better acquainted than before with cotton.
Hence it is distinctly mentioned by Theophrastus, the
disciple of Aristotle. He says, “The trees, from which the
Indians make cloths, have a leaf like that of the Black Mulberry;
but the whole plant resembles the dog-rose. They set
them in the plains arranged in rows, so as to look like vines at
a distance<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.” In a succeeding part of the same book (<i>c.</i> 7. <i>p.</i>
143, 144. <i>ed. Schneider</i>) he notices the growth of cotton, not
only in India, but in <i>Arabia</i>, and in the island called Tylos,
which he places in the Arabian Gulf, although it was probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
in the Persian Gulf, near the Arabian coast<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>. According to his
account in the latter passage, “The wool-bearing trees, which
grew abundantly in this island, had a leaf like that of the vine,
but smaller; they bore no fruit, but the capsule containing the
wool, was, when closed, about the size of a quince, when ripe,
it expanded so as to emit the wool, which was woven into
cloths, either cheap, or of great value.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Sprengel in his German translation (<i>p.</i> 150. <i>vol.</i> ii.) supposes
the Broussonetia Papyrifera to be meant in the former
passage. But he gives no good reason for this supposition, and
he admits, that the Broussonetia Papyrifera grows in China,
not in India. The expression of Theophrastus, ὥσπερ ἐλέχθη, which
he employs in the latter passage (<i>c.</i> 9. <i>p.</i> 144. <i>ed. Schneider</i>),
clearly proves, that he is speaking of the same plant in
both passages, and Sprengel himself (<i>p.</i> 164.) supposes the
Gossypium Arboreum of Linnæus, the Cotton Tree, to be
meant in the latter, though not in the former. The description
of Theophrastus is remarkably exact, if we consider it as applying,
not to the Cotton Tree (<i>Gossypium Arboreum</i>), but to
the Cotton Plant (<i>G. Herbaceum</i>), from which the chief supply
of cotton for spinning and weaving into cloth has always
been obtained.</p>

<p>Aristobulus, one of Alexander’s generals, made mention of
the cotton-plant under the name of the Wool-bearing Tree, and
stated that its capsule contained seeds, which were taken out, and
that what remained was combed like wool<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The testimony of Nearchus, who was the admiral of Alexander,
is also preserved to the following effect; “that there were
in India trees bearing, as it were, flocks or bunches of wool;
that the natives made linen garments of it, wearing a shirt,
which reached to the middle of the leg, a sheet folded about
the shoulders, and a turban rolled round the head; and that
the linen made by them from this substance was fine and
whiter than any other.” It is to be observed, that Nearchus, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
rather the two later authors who quote him, viz. Arrian and
Strabo, use the terms for linen in a general sense, as including
all fine light cloths made of vegetable substances<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.</p>

<p>We read in the account of India by Pomponius Mela (L. iii.
<i>c.</i> 7.), that the woods produced wool, used by the natives for
clothing. He distinctly mentions the use of flax likewise. It
has been conjectured, that he may have taken his account from
Nearchus, or some other Greek writer, and that he may have
intended to speak only of the use of cotton. But in reply to
this it is to be observed, that Pomponius Mela here mentions
flax in opposition to cotton, and that his assertion, so understood,
was probably true, since we have other evidence to show that
flax grows in India as well as cotton. (See <a href="#Part_FOURTH">Part IV.</a>) Nevertheless
it seems necessary to understand other authors of the
same period as meaning cotton by the term λίνον, or <i>linum</i>.
Thus Dyonisius Periegetes (<i>l.</i> 1116), speaking of the employments
of the Indians, says, Οἱ δὲ ἱστοὺς ὑφόωσι λινεργέας, which probably
meant “some weave muslins”. In the same manner we
must interpret the assertion of Quintus Curtius, “Terra <i>lini</i>
ferax, unde plerisque sunt vestes” i. e., The land produces
flax, from which the greater part obtain garments. Soon after
this Curtius says in terms more strictly proper,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Corpora usque pedes <i>carbaso</i> velant, soleis pedes, capita linteis vinciunt.</p>

<p>They cover their bodies from head to foot with <i>carbasus</i>; they bind shoes about
their feet, linen cloths about their heads.</p>
</div>

<p>Again, speaking of the dress of the King, he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Distincta sunt auro et purpurâ <i>carbasa</i>, quæ indutus est. L. viii. 9.</p>

<p>The <i>carbasa</i> which he wore, were spotted with purple and gold.</p>
</div>

<p>In like manner, Lucan, describing the Indian nations, says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent6">L. iii. <i>v.</i> 239.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Strabo says, (L. xv. <i>c.</i> 1. <i>vol.</i> vi. <i>p.</i> 153. ed. Sieb.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the Indians use white raiment, and fine white cloths and <i>carpasa</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>Also the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea states, that the region
about the Gulf of Barygaza in India was productive “of
<i>Carpasus</i> and of the fine Indian cloths made of it<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.” These
were what we now call <i>India muslins</i>. These muslins we
are informed by Dr. Vincent, were imported into Egypt, and
accordingly Pacatus<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> represents Antony’s army as wearing cotton
in that country.</p>

<p>The term <i>Carbasus</i>, is evidently used by the five last-cited
authors to signify cotton; for they employ it in describing the
common dress of the Indians. As the Greeks and Romans became
acquainted with cotton much earlier than with silk, we
find that <i>Carpas</i>, the proper Oriental name for cotton, was
also in use among them at a comparatively early period; and
we shall now endeavor to trace the progress of this term from
India, Westward. With little variation it is found in the same
sense in the Sanscrit, Arabic, and Persic languages<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>This word occurs once in the Hebrew Scriptures, viz. Esther,
i. 6., and there evidently as a foreign term. The hangings,
used to decorate the court of the royal palace at Susa on occasion
of the great feast given by Ahasuerus, are thus described
in the common version of the Scriptures:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine
linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and
silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble.”</p>
</div>

<p>The word, corresponding to “<i>green</i>” in the original is <i>Carpas</i>
(כרפס). It has been translated “green” by the authors of
the common version on the authority of the Chaldee Paraphrase.</p>

<p>The earliest instance of the use of the oriental name in any
classical author is the line from Statius Cæcilius, who died 169
B. C. as quoted by Nonius Marcellus (<i>l.</i> xvi.) from the <i>Pausimachus</i>
of Statius:</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Carbasina, molochina, ampelina<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
As these words are all three Greek, and the play, in which the
verse occurred, was also called by a Greek name, we cannot
doubt, that Statius translated it according to his usual custom
from one of the writers of the New Comedy. We may therefore
infer with some confidence from this expression, that the
Greeks made use of muslins or calicoes, or at least of cotton
cloths of some kind, which were brought from India as early
as 200 years B. C.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p>Statius chiefly copied from Menander (<i>Gellius</i> ii. <i>c.</i> 16.); but we cannot find,
that Menander wrote any play called <i>Pausimachus</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>After some time the oriental custom of using cotton as a
protection from the sun’s rays was adopted also by the Romans.
Cotton was not only a cheaper and commoner article than silk,
but it was particularly adapted for this purpose on account of
its lightness, as well as its beauty and fineness; and, besides the
instance already cited from the book of Esther, we may observe
also, that where the <i>Latin</i> authors mention the use of
“Carbasa,” it is sometimes for purposes of this kind. “Tabernacula
carbaseis intenta velis,” <i>i. e.</i> “Tents with coverings of
cotton,” were among the expensive novelties which contributed
to the luxury of Verres, when Prætor in Sicily<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. The same
species of ornament was first displayed at Rome in the magnificent
ædileship of P. Lentulus Spinther, at the Apollinarian
games and in the year 63 B. C.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At a later period awnings of linen were used to keep out the sun, but originally
in the theatres only, which contrivance was first adopted by Q. Catulus, when
he dedicated the capitol. After this Lentulus Spinther is said to have first introduced
cotton awnings in the theatre at the Apollinarian games. By and by
Cæsar the Dictator covered with awnings the whole Roman forum, and the sacred
way, from his own house even to the ascent of the Capitoline hill, which is said
to have appeared more wonderful than the gladiatorial exhibition itself. Afterwards,
without exhibiting games, Marcellus the son of Octavia, sister of Augustus,
when he was Ædile and his uncle consul the eleventh time<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>, on the day before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
the Kalends of August, protected the forum from the rays of the sun, that the
persons engaged in lawsuits might stand with less injury to their health. What
a change from the manners which prevailed under Cato the Censor, who thought
that the forum should even be strewed with caltrops! Of late sky-blue awnings,
spotted with stars, have been extended by means of strong ropes, even in the amphitheatre
of the Emperor Nero. Red awnings are used to cover the atria of
houses, and they defend the moss from the sun. As for the rest, white linen has
always remained in favor. This plant was honored in the Trojan war. <i>For
why should it not perform its part in battles as well as in shipwrecks?</i> Homer
testifies, that a few of his warriors fought in linen cuirasses. The tackle of his
ships was also of flax, according to some of his more learned interpreters, who argue
that by the term <i>sparta</i> he meant <i>sata</i>, or things that are sown.”&mdash;<i>Pliny</i>,
Lib. xix. chap. vi.</p>

<p>Lucretius apparently refers to the introduction by Lentulus
Spinther of the cotton awnings above mentioned (vi. 108.), when
he is theorising on the cause of thunder, and compares the
clouds spread over the sky to the awnings of calico, which
veiled the theatres and sheltered the spectators from the sun:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We now find frequent mention of cotton by the poets of the
Augustan age and by many subsequent writers. As in the
case of silk, these authors introduce cotton, not only historically,
but for the purpose of embellishment; and, considering <i>Carbasus</i>
as a poetical term, they often by a <i>catachresis</i> employ it
where they mean to speak of linen. Also as was before observed
in regard to silk (Part I. chapter II.), it may likewise be
noticed here, that the wars against Mithridates and the Parthians
may have contributed to make the Romans familiar
with the use of cotton, although their chief supply of it was
more probably through Egypt, than through Persia and Babylonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
Catullus (64.), speaking of the black sail which Ægeus furnished
for the ships of his son Theseus, calls it “<i>Carbasus
Ibera</i>,” “an Iberian sail.” As, on the one hand, he here uses
the proper term for cotton, without intending to describe the sail
as cotton, so on the other hand he calls the sail Iberian merely
because Iberia was a country adjoining Colchis, and from Colchis
(as will be shown in Part IV.) the Greeks and Romans
obtained a great supply of flax and sail-cloth.</p>

<p>Tibullus, or Lygdamus, entreats (iii. 2. 17.), in the contemplation
of his death and funeral, that after his bones have been
washed, first with wine, and then with milk, they may be dried
“carbaseis veils,” with linen napkins. Although he uses the
proper term for cotton, he probably did not intend to denote any
preference for cotton rather than linen. His bones, after being
wiped, were to be deposited in a marble urn.</p>

<p>Propertius seems to have aimed at a display of knowledge on
these subjects (see <a href="#Chapter1_II">Part First, chapter II.</a>); and in the following
passage (iv. 3.) he probably used <i>Carbasa</i> in its proper
sense, as he is referring to Eastern habits:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Raptave odorata carbasa lina duci.</p>

<p>Muslins taken among the spoils from a scented general.</p>
</div>

<p>In the last Elegy of the same Book he refers to the story of
the young Vestal virgin, who, when the flame was extinguished
upon the altar committed to her care, and when the scourge
appeared to await her for her neglect, threw upon the ashes a
fillet of muslin from her head, and saved her life by its ignition,
which was supposed to be effected by the favor of the goddess:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Vel cui, commissos cum Vesta reposceret ignes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exhibuit vivos carbasus alba focos.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fire had died, and Vesta urged her claim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the white cotton show’d a living flame.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The story is related by Valerius Maximus (i. 7.). Although
we are not informed of the date of the event, it appears from
his language that the fillet was of fine muslin: “Cum <i>carbasum,
quam optimum habebat</i>, foculo imposuisset, subito ignis
emicuit.” This description is well suited to the nature of cotton,
than which nothing was more easily ignited.</p>

<p>The passage in Virgil’s Georgics, which mentions cotton, has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
been already quoted (See <a href="#Page_24">Part I. chapter II. p. 24.</a>). By the
Æthiopians, whose groves were “white with soft wool,” he
probably intended those of Arabia; and we may suppose him to
have referred to accounts, not so much of the Gossypium Herbaceum,
to which the word “groves” (<i>nemora</i>) would not apply,
as to groves of Gossypium Arboreum and Bombyx Ceiba. In
the following passages of Æneid he mentions cotton under its
proper name, though probably not intending to distinguish accurately
between cotton and linen, and only using the term for
the sake of ornament:&mdash;</p>

<p>Pliny mentions cotton in four different passages of his Natural
History. Two of them are translated with some inaccuracies
from the passages of Theophrastus. To his translation
of one of these passages Pliny annexes the remark, derived
perhaps from some other source, that the inhabitants of Tylos
called their Cotton Trees <i>gossympins</i>, and that an island
which was called the smaller Tylos, distant ten miles, was still
more fertile in cotton than the larger island of the same name.</p>

<p>The third passage introduces cotton under its proper name,
Carbasa. It would imply that cotton was first grown or manufactured
at Tarraco in Spain, than which assertion nothing
can be more inaccurate and groundless.</p>

<p>The fourth passage is also contrary to all previous evidence,
inasmuch as it represents cotton to be the native growth of
Egypt. It calls the Cotton Plant <i>gossypion</i>, and hence the
name has been given to it by modern botanists. Supposing
this last passage to be genuine, still we know not on what authority
Pliny depended, or from what source he derived his information,
nor can we tell to what extent he allowed himself to
be inaccurate in transcribing or translating. Taken by itself,
therefore, it appears to us that this passage is no better proof of
the growth of cotton anciently in Egypt than the third passage
is of its first discovery in Spain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Upper Egypt, towards Arabia, there grows a shrub, which some call <i>gossypium</i>,
and others <i>xylon</i>, from which the stuffs are made which we call <i>xylina</i>.
It is small, and bears a fruit resembling the filbert, within which is a downy wool,
which is spun into thread. There is nothing to be preferred to these stuffs for
whiteness or softness: beautiful garments are made from them for the priests of
Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This passage seems however deserving of more consideration,
when taken in conjunction with the following from the Onomastícon
of Julius Pollux, who wrote 100 years later than
Pliny:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are also Byssina; and Byssus, a kind of flax. But among the Indians,
and now also among the Egyptians, a sort of wool is obtained from a tree. The
cloth made from this wool may be compared to linen, except that it is thicker.
The tree produces a fruit most nearly resembling a walnut, but three-cleft.
After the outer covering, which is like a walnut, has divided and become dry, the
substance resembling wool is extracted and is used in the manufacture of cloth
for woof, the warp being linen.</p>
</div>

<p>The description here given of the Cotton Tree or Cotton
Plant, whichever was meant, is remarkably correct; indeed
more correct than any account obtained since the time of the
expedition of Alexander. The circumstance of the pericarp
being three-cleft is agreeable to the fact, <i>and is not noticed by
any earlier writer</i>. The comparison of it to a walnut in regard
to size and form is also accurate. From this account, and
from those of Theophrastus, Aristobulus, and Nearchus, we
gather the following particulars, which are agreeable to the
fact: that the cotton-plants are set in the plains, and in rows
like vines; that the plant is three or four feet high, and is
branched, spreading, and flexible, like a dog-rose; that the leaf
is palmated like that of the vine; that the capsule is three-valved,
about the size of a walnut, and, when it bursts, emits the
cotton, resembling flocks of wool, in which the seeds are imbedded.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have had no previous evidence respecting
the use of cotton in the manufacture of cloth <i>for the
woof only</i>, and it is doubtful whether this piece of information
is correct, <i>because we have no reason to suppose that cotton
was used for weaving in any country in which flax was also
spun and woven</i>.</p>

<p>Tertullian in the third Chapter of his treatise De Pallio,
enumerates nearly all the raw materials which were spun for
weaving. He mentions the class of vegetable substances (cotton
and flax) in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Et arbusta vestiunt, et lini herbida post virorem lavacro nivescunt.</p>

<p>Both thickets supply clothing; and crops of flax, after being green, are rendered
by washing white as snow.</p>

<p>From the travels of the two Arabians who visited China in
the ninth century, we learn that at that time the ordinary dress
of their countrymen was cotton: for they remark, that “the
Chinese dressed, not in cotton, as the Arabians did, but in
silk<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>.” Probably the use of imported cotton might by this time
have become not uncommon in Egypt, Syria, and other oriental
countries; but we apprehend, that it was never generally employed
in Europe either for clothing, or for any other purpose,
until very lately.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to further discuss the question as to whether
cotton was or was not cultivated in Egypt in ancient times.
This vexed question having been lately set at rest, by a discovery
which reduces a great deal of the learning that has been
expended upon it <i>to the character of old lumber</i>. The difficulty
of ascertaining whether the mummy-cloths (of which the
specimens are exceedingly numerous) were made of linen or
cotton, has at length been overcome; and though no chemical
test could be found out to settle the question, it has been decided
by that important aid to scientific scrutiny, the microscope.

<p>The following observations of Dr. Robertson in his “Historical
Disquisition concerning the knowledge which the Ancients

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If the use of the cotton manufactures of India had been common among the
Romans, the various kinds of them would have been enumerated in the Law <i>De
Publicanis et Vectigalibus</i>, in the same manner as the different kinds of spices and
precious stones. Such a specification would have been equally necessary for the
direction both of the merchant and of the tax-gatherer.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
In confirmation of these remarks it may be observed, that the
passages collected in this chapter represent cotton cloth as an
expensive and curious production rather than as an article of
common use among the Greeks and Romans. Among the ancients
linen must have been far cheaper than cotton, whereas
the improvements in navigation, the discovery of the passage
to India by the Cape of Good Hope, and still more the discovery
of America, have now made cotton the cheaper article among
us, and have thus brought it into general use.</p>

<p>India produces several varieties of cotton, both of the herbaceous
and the tree kinds. Marco Polo mentions that “cotton
is produced in Guzerat in large quantities from a tree that is
about six yards in height, and bears during twenty years; but
the cotton taken from trees of this age is not adapted for spinning,
but only <i>quilting</i>. Such, on the contrary, as is taken
from trees of twelve years old, is suitable for muslins and other
manufactures of extraordinary fineness<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>.” Sir John Mandeville,
on the other hand, who travelled in the fourteenth century,
fifty years later than Polo, mentions the annual herbaceous
cotton as cultivated in India: he says&mdash;“In many places the
seed of the cotton, (cothon,) which we call tree-wool, is sown
every year, and there springs up from its copses of low shrubs,
on which this wool grows<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>.” Forbes also, in his Oriental Memoirs,
thus describes the herbaceous cotton of Guzerat:&mdash;“The
cotton shrub, which grows to the height of three or four feet,
and in verdure resembles the currant bush, requires a longer
time than rice (which grows up and is reaped in three months)
to bring its delicate produce to perfection. The shrubs are
planted between the rows of rice, but do not impede its growth,
or prevent its being reaped. Soon after the rice harvest is over,
the cotton bushes put forth a beautiful yellow flower, with a
crimson eye in each petal; this is succeeded by a green pod,
filled with a white stringy pulp; the pod turns brown and
hard as it ripens, and then separates into two or three divisions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
containing the cotton. A luxuriant field, exhibiting at the
same time the expanding blossom, the bursting capsule, and
the snowy flakes of ripe cotton, is one of the most beautiful objects
in the agriculture of Hindostan<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>.”</p>

<p>The following general statement concerning the cotton of
India, is from the geographical work of Malte Brun:&mdash;“The
cotton-tree grows on all the Indian mountains, but its produce
is coarse in quality: the herbaceous cotton prospers chiefly in
Bengal and on the Coromandel coast, and there the best cotton
goods are manufactured. Next to these two provinces, Maduré,
Marawar, Pescaria, and the coast of Malabar, produce the finest
cotton<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>.” He elsewhere says&mdash;“Cotton is cultivated in every
part of India: the finest grows in the light rocky soil of Guzerat,
Bengal, Dude, and Agra. The cultivation of this plant is
very lucrative, an acre producing about nine quintals of cotton
in the year<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>.”</p>

<p>On the discovery of this continent by Columbus, Cotton
formed the principal article of clothing among the Mexicans.</p>

<p>We are informed by the Abbé Clavigero that “of cotton the
Mexicans made <i>large webs</i>, and as delicate and fine as those
of Holland, which were, with much reason, highly esteemed in
Europe. They wove their cloths <i>of different figures</i> and
<i>colors</i>, representing <i>different animals</i> and <i>flowers</i>. Of feathers
interwoven with cotton, they made <i>mantles</i> and <i>bed-curtains</i>,
<i>carpets</i>, <i>gowns</i>, and other things, not less soft than
beautiful. With cotton also they <i>interwove the finest hair of
the belly of rabbits and hares, after having spun it into
thread</i>: of this they made most beautiful cloths, and in particular
winter waistcoats for their lords<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>.” Among the presents
sent by Cortes, the conqueror of Mexico, to Charles V.,
were “cotton mantles, some all white, others mixed with white
and black, or red, green, yellow, and blue; waistcoats, handkerchiefs,
counterpanes, tapestries, and carpets of cotton; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
colors of the cotton were extremely fine<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>.” That the Mexicans
should have understood the art of dyeing those beautiful colors
referred to in the above extract, is not to be wondered at when
we consider that they had both <i>indigo</i> and <i>cochineal</i> among
their native productions.</p>

and on the continent of South America, where the inhabitants
wore cotton dresses, and made their fishing nets of the same
material<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>; and when Magellan went on his circumnavigation

<p>The antiquity of the cotton manufacture in India having
been noticed in the last chapter, the present one will give some
account of the remarkable excellence of the Indian fabrics,&mdash;the
processes and machines by which they are wrought,&mdash;the
condition of the population engaged in this department of industry,&mdash;the
extensive commerce formerly carried on in these
productions to every quarter of the globe, and the causes that
have tended to destroy it.</p>

<p>The Indians have in all ages maintained an unapproached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
and almost incredible perfection in their fabrics of cotton. Indeed
some of their muslins might be thought the work of
fairies or insects, rather than of men; but these are produced in
small quantities, and have seldom been exported. In the same
province from which the ancient Greeks obtained the finest
muslins then known, namely, the province of Bengal, these
astonishing fabrics are manufactured to the present day<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.</p>

<p>We learn from two Arabian travellers of the ninth century,
that “in this country (India) they make garments of such extraordinary
perfection, that nowhere else are the like to be seen.
These garments are for the most part round, and wove to that
degree of fineness that they may be drawn through a ring of
moderate size<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>.” Marco Polo, in the thirteenth century, mentions
the coast of Coromandel, and especially Masulipatam, as
producing “the finest and most beautiful cottons that are to be
found in any part of the world<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>;” and this is still the case as to
the flowered and glazed cottons, called chintzes, though the
muslins of the Coromandel coast are inferior to those of Bengal.</p>

<p>Odoardo Barbosa, one of the Portuguese adventurers who
visited India immediately after the discovery of the passage by
the Cape of Good Hope, celebrates “the great quantities of cotton
cloths admirably painted, also some white and some striped,
held in the highest estimation,” which were made in Bengal<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.
Cæsar Frederick, a Venetian merchant, who travelled in India
in 1563, and whose narrative is translated by Hakluyt, describes
the extensive traffic carried on between St. Thomé (a port
150 miles from Negapatam) and Pegu, in “<i>bumbast</i> (cotton)
cloth of every sort, painted, which is a rare thing, because this
kind of cloths show as if they were gilded with divers colors,
and the more they are washed, the livelier the colors will become;
and there is made such account of this kind of cloth,
that a small bale of it will cost 1000 or 2000 ducats<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.”</p>

Tavernier, who, like Marco Polo, Barbosa, and Frederick,
was a merchant as well as a traveller, and therefore accustomed
to judge of the qualities of goods, and who travelled in the middle
of the seventeenth century, says&mdash;“The white calicuts,”
(calicoes, or rather muslins, so called from the great commercial
city of Calicut, whence the Portuguese and Dutch first brought
them) “are woven in several places in Bengal and Mogulistan,
and are carried to Raioxsary and Baroche<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> to be whitened, because
of the large meadows and plenty of lemons that grow
thereabouts, for they are never so white as they should be till
they are dipped in <i>lemon-water</i>. Some calicuts are made so
fine, <i>you can hardly feel them in your hand</i>, and the thread,
when spun, is scarce discernible<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.” The same writer says,
“There is made at Seconge (in the province of Malwa) a sort
of calicut so fine that when a man puts it on, <i>his skin shall
appear as plainly through it, as if he was quite naked</i>; but
the merchants are not permitted to transport it, for the governor
is obliged to send it all to the Great Mogul’s seraglio and the
principal lords of the court, to make the sultanesses and noblemen’s
wives shifts and garments for the hot weather; and the
king and the lords take great pleasure to behold them in these
shifts, and see them dance with nothing else upon them<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>.”
Speaking of the turbans of the Mohammedan Indians, Tavernier
says, “The rich have them of so fine cloth, that twenty-five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
or thirty ells of it put into a turban will not weigh four
ounces<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_445" href="#FNanchor_445" class="label">[445]</a> “At the town of Baroche, in Guzerat, Forbes describes the manufacture as
being now in nearly the same state as when Arrian’s Periplus was written (about
A. D. 100.). He says&mdash;”The cotton trade at Baroche is very considerable, and
the manufactures of this valuable plant, from the finest muslin to the coarsest
sail-cloth, employ thousands of men, women, and children, in the metropolis
and the adjacent villages. The cotton clearers and spinners generally reside in
the suburbs, or poorahs, of Baroche, which are very extensive. The weavers’
houses are mostly near the shade of tamarind and mango trees, under which, at
sun-rise, they fix their looms, and weave a variety of cotton cloth, with very fine
baftas and muslins (See <a href="#Plate_V">Plate V.</a>). Surat is more famous for its colored chintzes
and piece goods. The Baroche muslins are inferior to those of Bengal and Madras,
nor do the painted chintzes of Guzerat equal those of the Coromandel coast.”&mdash;Forbes’s

<p>An English writer, at the end of the seventeenth century, in
a remonstrance against the admission of India muslins, for
which, he says, the high price of thirty shillings a yard was
paid, unintentionally compliments the delicacy of the fabric by
stigmatizing it as “only the <i>shadow</i> of a commodity<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>.”</p>

<p>The late Rev. William Ward, a missionary at Serampore,
informs us that “at Shantee-pooru and Dhaka, muslins are
made which sell at a hundred rupees a piece. The ingenuity
of the Hindoos in this branch of manufacture is wonderful.
Persons with whom I have conversed on this subject say, that
at two places in Bengal, Sonar-ga and Vilkrum-pooru, muslins
are made by a few families so exceedingly fine, that four
months are required to weave one piece, which sells at five hundred
rupees. When this muslin is laid on the grass, and the
dew has fallen upon it, <i>it is no longer discernible</i><a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>After such statements as the above, from sober and creditable
witnesses, the Oriental hyperbole which designates the Dacca
muslins as “<i>webs of woven wind</i>,” seems only moderately poetical.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Wilkins brought a specimen of Dacca muslin
from India in the year 1786, which was presented to him by
the principal of the East India Company’s factory at Dacca, as
the finest then made there. Like all Indian muslins, it has a
yellowish hue, caused by imperfect bleaching. Though the
worse for many years’ exposure in a glass case, and the handling
of visitors, it is of exquisite delicacy, softness, and transparency;
yet the yarn of which it is woven, and of which Mr.
Wilkins also brought a specimen, is not so fine as some which
has been spun by machinery in England. The following
minute, made by Sir Joseph Banks on a portion of this yarn,
thirty or forty years since, appears at the India House in his
own writing, together with a specimen of the muslin:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
“The portion of skein which Mr. Wilkins gave to me
weighed 34³⁄₁₀ grains: its length was 5 yards 7 inches, and it
consisted of 196 threads. Consequently, its whole length was
1018 yards and 7 inches. This, with a small allowance for
fractions, gives 29 yards to a grain, 203,000 to a pound avoirdupoise
of 7000 grains; that is, 115 miles, 2 furlongs, and 60
yards.”</p>

<p>Cotton yarn has been spun in England, making <i>three hundred
and fifty hanks</i> to the <i>lb. weight</i>, each hank measuring
840 yards, and the whole forming a thread of 167 miles in
length<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>. This, however, must be regarded merely as showing
how fine the cotton can possibly be spun by machinery, since
no such yarn is or could be used in the making of muslins, or
for any other purpose. The extreme of fineness to which
yarns for muslins are ever spun in Great Britain is 250 hanks
to the lb., which would form a thread measuring 119⅓ miles;
but it is very rarely indeed that finer yarn is used than 220
hanks to the lb., which is less fine than the specimen of Dacca
muslin above mentioned. The Indian hand-spun yarn is softer
than mule-yarn, and the muslins made of the former are
much more durable than those made of the latter. In point
of appearance, however, the book-muslin of Glasgow is very
superior to the Indian muslin, not only because it is better
bleached, but because it is more evenly woven, and from yarn
of uniform thickness, whereas the threads in the Indian fabric
vary considerably.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_451" href="#FNanchor_451" class="label">[451]</a> Pliny, in speaking of linen yarn, gives us an account (L. xix. cap. 2.) of the
cuirass of the Egyptian king Amasis, which is preserved in the temple of Minerva
in Rhodes. “Each thread,” says he, “is shown to consist of 365 fibres, which
fact Mucianus, being a third time Consul, lately asserted at Rome.”&mdash;Mucianus
was Consul the third time A. D. 75.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It is probable that the specimens brought by Wilkins, though
the finest then made at the city of Dacca, is not equal to the
most delicate muslins made in that neighborhood in former
times, or even in the present. The place called by the Rev.
Mr. Ward Sonar-ga, and, by Mr. Walter Hamilton, Sooner-gong,
a decayed city near Dacca, has been said to be unrivalled
in its muslins. Mr. Ward’s testimony has been quoted above.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
Mr. Ralph Fitch, an English traveller, in 1583, spoke of the
same place when he said&mdash;“Sinnergan is a town six leagues
from Serrapore, where there is the best and finest cloth made of
cotton that is in all India<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>.” Mr. Hamilton says&mdash;“Soonergong
is now dwindled down to an inconsiderable village. By Abul
Fazel, in 1582, it is celebrated for the manufacture of a beautiful
cloth, named <i>cassas</i> (cossaes,) and the fabrics it still produces
justify to the present generation its ancient renown<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>”.
But it seems that there has been a great decline in the manufacture
of the finest muslins, which is both stated and accounted
for by Mr. Hamilton in the following passage on the
district of Dacca Jelulpoor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>
</div>

<p>“Plain muslins, are distinguished by different names, according
to the fineness or closeness of the texture, as well as <i>flowered</i>,
<i>striped</i>, or <i>chequered</i> muslins, are fabricated chiefly in this
district, where a species of cotton named the banga grows, necessary,
although not of a very superior quality, to form the
stripes of the finest muslins, for which the city of Dacca has
been so long celebrated. The northern parts of Benares furnish
both plain and flowered muslins, which are not ill adapted for
common use, though incapable of sustaining any competition
with the beautiful and inimitable fabrics of Dacca.</p>

<p>“The export of the above staple articles has much decreased,
and the art of manufacturing some of the finest species of muslins
is in danger of being lost, the orders for them being so few
that many of the families who possess by <i>hereditary</i> instruction
the art of fabricating them have desisted, on account of
the difficulty they afterwards experience in disposing of them.
This decline may partly be accounted for from the utter stagnation
of demand in the upper provinces since the downfall of
the imperial government, prior to which these delicate and
beautiful fabrics were in such estimation, not only at the court
of Delhi, but among all classes of the high nobility in India, as
to render it difficult to supply the demand. Among more recent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
causes also may be adduced the French revolution, the degree
of perfection to which this peculiar manufacture has lately
been brought in Great Britain, the great diminution in the
Company’s investment, and the advance in the price of cotton.”</p>

<p>With respect to the peculiar species of cotton of which the
Dacca muslins are made, the following statement was given to
a committee of the House of Commons, in 1830-31, by Mr.
John Crawfurd, for many years in the service of the East India
Company, and author of the “History of the Indian Archipelago:”</p>

<p>“There is a fine variety of cotton in the neighborhood of
Dacca, from which I have reason to believe the fine muslins of
Dacca are produced, and probably to the accidental discovery
of it is to be attributed the rise of this singular manufacture;
it is cultivated by the natives alone, not at all known in the
English market, nor, as far as I am aware, in that of Calcutta.
Its growth extends about forty miles along the banks of the
Megna, and about three miles inland. I consulted Mr. Colebrook
respecting the Dacca cotton, and had an opportunity of
perusing the manuscripts of the late Dr. Roxburgh, which contain
an account of it; he calls it a variety of the common herbaceous
annual cotton of India, and states that it is longer in the
staple, and affords the material from which the Dacca muslins
have been always made.”</p>

<p>The cotton manufacture in India is not carried on in a few
large towns, or in one or two districts; it is universal. The
growth of cotton is nearly as general as the growth of food;
everywhere the women spend a portion of their time in spinning;
and almost every village contains its weavers, and supplies
its own inhabitants with the scanty clothing they require<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>.
Being a domestic manufacture, and carried on with the rudest
and cheapest apparatus, it requires neither capital, mills, or an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
assemblage of various trades. The cotton is separated from
the seeds by a small rude hand-mill, or gin, turned by women.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_454" href="#FNanchor_454" class="label">[454]</a> Orme, in his Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire, says, “On the
coast of Coromandel and in the province of Bengal, when at some distance from
the high road or a principal town, it is difficult to find a village in which every
man, woman, and child is not employed in making a piece of cloth. At present,
much the greatest part of the whole provinces are employed in this single manufacture.”
(p. 409.) “The progress of the cotton manufacture includes no less than
a description of the lives of half the inhabitants of Indostan.” (p. 413.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The mill consists of two rollers of teak wood, fluted longitudinally
with five or six grooves, and revolving nearly in contact.
The upper roller is turned by a handle, the lower being carried
along with it by means of a perpetual screw at the axis. The
cotton is put in at one side, and drawn through by the revolving
rollers; but the seeds, being too large to pass through the
opening, are torn off and fall down on the opposite side from
the cotton<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_455" href="#FNanchor_455" class="label">[455]</a> To the efforts of Eli Whitney, America is indebted for the value of her great
staple. While the invention of the cotton gin has been the chief source of the
prosperity of the Southern planter, the Northern manufacturer comes in for a
large share of the benefits derived from this most important offspring of American
ingenuity.</p>

<p>Eli Whitney, who may with justice be considered one of the most ingenious
and extraordinary men that ever lived, was born in Westborough, Worcester
County, Massachusetts, December 8th, 1765. His parents belonged to that respectable
class in society, who, by the labors of husbandry, manage, <i>by uniform
industry</i>, to provide well for a rising family,&mdash;a class from whom have risen most
of those who, in New England, have attained to high eminence and usefulness.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Whitney’s machines have benefited the people of this country,
and the world at large, millions upon millions, yet, it is to be lamented that he
did not reap that reward which his ingenuity and industry, as well as virtuous
course of conduct so richly merited, but died much involved in debt, while thousands
who had conspired to defraud him of his just and lawful rights, were enriched
by the use of his machines.</p>

<p>“If we should assert,” said Judge William Johnson, “that the benefits of this
invention (the Cotton gin) exceed $100,000,000, we can prove the assertion by
correct calculation.”</p>

<p>Who is there that, like him, has given his country and the world a machine&mdash;the
product of his own skill&mdash;which has furnished a large part of its population,
from childhood to age, with a lucrative employment; by which their debts have
been paid off; their capitals increased; their lands trebled in value?</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney died on the 8th of January 1825, and is buried in the cemetery
of New Haven, Connecticut. His tomb is after the model of Scipio’s at Rome.
It is simple and beautiful, and promises to endure for years. It bears the following
inscription.</p>

<p class="center">

  </p>

<p>The convention of American Geologists and Naturalists who met at New Haven
in May last (1845.), were invited, together with their ladies, by Mrs. Whitney,
the <i>widow of the inventor of the Cotton gin</i>, to attend an evening party at
her house, which was accepted, where they had an elegant supper and conversazione.</p>

<p>“It is melancholy,” says Mr. Bains in his History of the Cotton Manufacture,
p. 114, “to contrast with the sanguine eagerness of inventors, the slowness of
mankind to acknowledge and reward their merits,&mdash;to observe how, on many occasions,
genius, instead of realizing fame and fortune, has been pursued by disaster
and opposition,&mdash;how trifling difficulties have frustrated the success of splendid
discoveries,&mdash;and how those discoveries, snatched from the grasp of their broken-hearted
authors, have brought princely fortunes to men whose <i>only</i> talent was in
making money. When inventors fail in their projects, no one pities them; when
they succeed, persecution, envy, and jealousy are their reward. Their means
are generally exhausted before their discoveries become productive. They plant
a vineyard, and either starve, or are driven from their inheritance, before they can
gather the fruit.”</p>

<p>Would it not be greatly to the credit of the cotton manufacturing interest in
this country and in Europe, to present Mrs. Whitney with some token of their
respect and veneration for the memory of the inventor of the Cotton gin?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
The next operation is that of bowing the cotton, to clear it
from dirt and knots. A large bow, made elastic by a complication
of strings, is used; this being put in contact with a heap
of cotton, the workman strikes the string with a heavy wooden
mallet, and its vibrations open the knots of the cotton, shake
from it the dust and dirt, and raise it to a downy fleece. The
hand-mill and bow have been used immemorially throughout
all the countries of Asia, and have their appropriate names in
the Arabic and other languages: they were formerly used in
America, whence the term, still applied in commerce, “<i>bowed
Georgia cotton</i>.” The hatters of Great Britain still raise their
wool by the bow. The cotton being thus prepared, without
any carding, it is spun by the women; the coarse yarn is spun
on a one-thread wheel, and very much resembling those used
at the present day by the peasantry in the west of Ireland.</p>

<p>The finer yarn is spun with a metallic spindle, and sometimes
without a distaff; a bit of clay is attached as a weight to
one end of the spindle, which is turned round with the left
hand, whilst the cotton is supplied with the right; the thread is
wound upon a small piece of wood. The spinster keeps her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
fingers dry by the use of a chalky powder. (See Part First,
Chapter I, pp. <a href="#Page_17">17</a> and <a href="#Page_17">18</a>.)</p>

<p>The yarn, having been reeled and warped in the simplest
possible manner, is given to the weaver whose loom is as rude
a piece of apparatus as can be imagined. It consists merely of
two bamboo rollers, one for the warp and the other for the web,
and a pair of headles. The shuttle performs the double office of
shuttle and lay, and for this purpose is made like a large netting
needle, and of a length rather more than the breadth of the
web<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>. This apparatus the weaver carries to a tree, under
which he digs a hole (which may be called the <i>treadle-hole</i>)
large enough to contain his legs and the lower tackle. He then
stretches his warp by fastening his bamboo rollers at a proper
distance from each other by means of wooden pins. The
headle-jacks he fastens to some convenient branch of the tree
over his head (See <a href="#Plate_V">Plate V.</a>): two loops underneath, <i>in which
he inserts his great toes</i>, serve instead of treadles; and his
long shuttle, which also performs the office of lay, draws the
weft through the warp, and afterwards strikes it home to the
fell. “There is not so much as an expedient for rolling up the
warp: it is stretched out to the full length of the web, which
makes the house of the weaver insufficient to contain him.
He is therefore obliged to work continually in the open air; and
every return of inclement weather interrupts him<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_456" href="#FNanchor_456" class="label">[456]</a> The shuttle is not always of this length. Hoole, in his “Mission to India,”
represents it as requiring to be <i>thrown</i>, in which case it must be short; and a
drawing of a Candyan weaver, in the Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge, shows the shuttle of the same size as our modern shawl
shuttle. Indeed we have abundant evidence that the Indians employed shuttles
of this latter description from time immemorial. The Chinese also use shuttles
of the same description. (See Chinese loom, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>)</p>

<p>Forbes describes the weavers in Guzerat, near Baroche, as
fixing their looms at sun-rise under the shade of tamarind and
mango trees. In some parts of India, however, as on the
banks of the Ganges, the weavers work under the cover of their
sheds, fixing the geer of their looms to a bamboo in the roof
(See <a href="#Plate_V">Plate V.</a>). They size their warps with a starch made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
from the root called <i>kandri</i>. When chequered muslins are
wrought, three persons are employed at each loom.</p>

<p>Some authentic particulars concerning the habits and remuneration
of the Hindoos engaged in the making of cotton cloth,
are contained in an unpublished account of the districts of
Puraniya (Purneah,) Patna, and Dinajpur, by Dr. Francis
Hamilton, better known as Dr. F. Buchanan, (he having taken
the name of Hamilton,) the author of the “Journey from Madras
to Mysore, Canara, and Malabar.” This account of the
above-named provinces near the Ganges is in several manuscript
volumes in the library of the India House, in London.
We learn from his elaborate survey that the spinning and
weaving of cotton prevails throughout these provinces. The
fine yarns are spun with an iron spindle, and without distaff,
generally by women of rank; no caste is disgraced here by
spinning, as in the south of India; the women do not employ
all their time at this work, but only so much as is allowed by
their domestic occupations. The coarse yarns are spun on a
small wheel turned by the hand. The hand-mill is used to
free the cotton from its seeds, and the bow to tease it. The
following capital is required for the weaver’s business: a loom,
2½ rupees; sticks for warping and a wheel for winding, 2 anas;
a shop, 4 rupees; thread for two ready money pieces, worth 6
rupees each, 5 rupees;&mdash;total 11 rupees 10 anas; to which
must be added a month’s subsistence. The man and his wife
warp, wind, and weave two pieces of this kind in a month, and
he has 7 rupees (14 shillings stg.) profit, deducting, however,
the tear and wear of his apparatus, which is a trifle. A person
hired to weave can in a month make three pieces of this kind,
and is allowed 2 anas in the rupee of their value, which is 2¼
rupees (4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) a month. The finest goods cost 2 rupees a
piece for weaving. Dr. Hamilton, in his observations on another
district, states the average profit of a loom engaged in
weaving coarse goods to be 28 rupees (£2. 16<i>s.</i>) a year, or
something less than 13<i>d.</i> a week. At Puraniya and Dinajpur
the journeymen cotton-weavers usually made from 2 to 2½ rupees
(from 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>) a month. At Patna a man and his wife
made from 3 to 4 rupees (from 6<i>s.</i> to 8<i>s.</i>) a month by beating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
and cleaning cotton; and each loom employed in making chequered
muslins, has a profit of 108½ rupees a year (£10. 16<i>s.</i>),
that is, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a week for each of the three persons who work
the loom. The average earnings of a journeyman weaver,
therefore, appear to be from 1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per week. At Bangalore,
and in some other parts of southern India, this author
states that weavers earn from 3<i>d.</i> to 8<i>d.</i> a day, according as
they are employed on coarse or fine goods<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>; but this is so much
above the usual remuneration for labor in India, that, if the
statement is not erroneous, it must be of extremely limited application.
On the same authority, a woman spinning coarse
yarn can earn 1⅔<i>d.</i> per day<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>.</p>

<p>A fact is mentioned by Dr. Hamilton, in his unpublished account
of Patna, which affords a striking indication as to the
national character of the Hindoos&mdash;“All Indian weavers, who
work for the common market, make the woof of one end of the
cloth coarser than that of the other, and attempt to sell to the
unwary by the fine end, although every one almost, who deals
with them, is perfectly aware of the circumstance, and although
in the course of his life any weaver may not ever have an opportunity
of gaining by this means, yet he continues the practice,
with the hope of being able at some time or other to take
advantage of the purchaser of his goods.”</p>

<p>The East India Company has a factory at Dacca, and also
in other parts of India,&mdash;not, as the American use of the word
“factory” might seem to imply, a mill, for the manufacture is
entirely domestic&mdash;but a commercial establishment in a manufacturing
district, where the spinners, weavers, and other workmen
are chiefly employed in providing the goods which the
Company export to Europe. This establishment is under the
management of a commercial resident, who agrees for the
kinds of goods that may be required, and superintends the execution
of the orders received from the presidencies. Such is
the poverty of the workmen, and even of the manufacturers
who employ them, that the resident has to advance beforehand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
the funds necessary in order to produce the goods. The consequence
of this system is, that the manufacturers and their
men are in a state of dependence almost amounting to servitude.
The resident obtains their labor at his own price, and,
being supported by the civil and military power, he establishes
a monopoly of the worst kind, and productive of the most prejudicial
effects to industry. The Act of 1833, which put an end
to the commercial character of the Company, will of course
abolish all the absurd and oppressive monopolies it exercised.</p>

<p>It cannot but seem astonishing, that in a department of industry,
where the raw material has been so grossly neglected,
where the machinery is so rude, and where there is so little
division of labor, the results should be fabrics of the most exquisite
delicacy and beauty, <i>unrivalled by the products of any
other nation, even those best skilled in the mechanic arts</i>.
This anomaly is explained by the remarkably fine sense of
touch possessed by that effeminate people, by their patience and
gentleness, and by the hereditary continuance of a particular
species of manufacture in families through many generations,
which leads to the training of children from their very infancy
in the processes of the art. Mr. Orme observes&mdash;“The women
spin the thread destined for the cloth, and then deliver it to the
men, who have fingers to model it as exquisitely as these have
prepared it. The rigid, clumsy fingers of a European would
scarcely be able to make a piece of canvass with the instruments
which are all that an Indian employs in making a piece
of cambric (muslin). It is further remarkable, that every distinct
kind of cloth is the production of a particular district, in
which the fabric has been transmitted perhaps for centuries
from father to son,&mdash;<i>a custom which must have conduced to
the perfection of the manufacture</i><a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>.” The last mentioned
fact may be considered as a kind of division of labor.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Mill thus explains the unequalled manual skill of the Indian
weaver:&mdash;“It is a sedentary occupation, and thus in harmony
with his predominant inclination. It requires patience,
of which he has an inexhaustible fund. It requires little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
bodily exertion, of which he is always exceedingly sparing;
and the finer the production, the more slender the force which
he is called upon to apply. But this is not all. The weak and
delicate frame of the Hindu is accompanied with an acuteness
of external sense, particularly of touch, which is altogether unrivalled;
and the flexibility of his fingers is equally remarkable.
The hand of the Hindu, therefore, constitutes an organ adapted
to the finest operations of the loom, in a degree which is almost
or altogether peculiar to himself<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>.”</p>

<p>It is, then, to a physical organization in the natives, admirably
suited to the processes of spinning and weaving; to the
possession of the raw material in the greatest abundance; to
the possession also of the <i>most brilliant dyes</i> for <i>staining</i> and
<i>printing</i> the cloth; to a climate which renders the colors lively
and durable; and to the hereditary practice, by particular
castes, classes, and families, both of the manual operations and
chemical processes required in the manufacture;&mdash;it is to these
causes, with very little aid from science, and in an almost barbarous
state of the mechanical arts, that India owes her long
supremacy in the manufacture of cotton.</p>

<p>Bengal is celebrated for the production of the finest muslins;
the Coromandel coast, for the best chintzes and calicoes; and
Surat, for strong and inferior goods of every kind. The cottons
of Bengal go under the names of <i>casses</i>, <i>amâns</i>, and <i>garats</i>;
and the handkerchiefs are called Burgoses and Steinkirkes.
<i>Table cloths</i> of superior quality are made at <i>Patna</i>. The
<i>basins</i>, or <i>basinets</i>, come from the Northern Circars. Condaver
furnishes the beautiful handkerchiefs of Masulipatam, the fine
colors of which are partly obtained from a plant called <i>chage</i>,
which grows on the banks of the Krishna, and on the coast of
the Bay of Bengal. The chintzes and ginghams are chiefly
made at Masulipatam, Madras, St. Thomé, and Paliamcotta.
The long cloths and fine pullicats are produced in the presidency
of Madras. The coarse piece-goods, under the name of
baftas, doutis, and pullicats, as well as common muslins and
chintzes, are extensively manufactured in the district of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
Surat is the port. Besides all these, there is an endless variety
of fabrics, many of which are known in the markets of Europe,
Asia, and Africa.</p>

<p>The commerce of the Indians in these fabrics has been extensive,
from the Christian era to the end of the last century.
For many hundred years, Persia, Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Abyssinia,
and all the eastern parts of Africa, were supplied with a
considerable portion of their cottons and muslins, and with all
which they consumed of the finest qualities, from the marts of
India. This commerce existed in the last age, and is described
by the Abbé Raynal<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> and Legoux de Flaix. The blue calicoes
of Guzerat were long bought by the English and Dutch for
their trade with Guinea. The great marts of this commerce
on the west coast of India were Surat and Calicut, the former
of which is near to Baroche, the manufacturing capital of Guzerat,
in which province a considerable part of the exported cottons
of India were made; and on the east coast, Masulipatam,
Madras, and St. Thomé, whence the varied and extensive
products of the Coromandel coast are exported.</p>

<p>Owing to the beauty and cheapness of Indian muslins,
chintzes, and calicoes, there was a period when the manufacturers
of all the countries of Europe were apprehensive of being
ruined by their competition. In the seventeenth century,
the Dutch and English East India Companies imported these
goods in large quantities; they became highly fashionable for
ladies’ and children’s dresses, as well as for drapery and furniture,
and the coarse calicoes were used to line garments. To
such an extent did this proceed, that as early as 1678 a loud
outcry was made in England against the admission of Indian
goods, which, it was maintained, were ruining the woollen
manufacture,&mdash;a branch of industry which for centuries was
regarded with an almost superstitious veneration, as a kind of
palladium of the national prosperity, and which was incomparably
the most extensive branch of manufactures till the close
of the eighteenth century. A few extracts from pamphlets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
published in the seventeenth and at the beginning of the
eighteenth century, will not only afford amusement, but will
show the wonderful commercial revolution which has since
been effected by machinery. In the year 1678, a pamphlet
was issued under the title&mdash;“The Ancient Trades Decayed
and Repaired again,” in which the author thus bewails the interference
of cotton with woollen fabrics.</p>

<p>“This trade (the woollen) is very much hindered by our own
people, who do wear many foreign commodities instead of our
own; as may be instanced in many particulars; viz. instead of
green <i>sey</i>, that was wont to be used for children’s frocks, is now
used painted and Indian-stained and striped calico; and instead
of a perpetuana or shalloon to line men’s coats with, is used
sometimes a glazed calico, which in the whole is not above 12<i>d.</i>
cheaper, and abundantly worse. And sometimes is used a
<i>Bangale</i> that is brought from India, both for linings to coats,
and for petticoats too; yet our English ware is better and
cheaper than this, only it is thinner for the summer. To remedy
this, it would be necessary to lay a very high impost upon
all such commodities as these are, and that no calicoes or
other sort of linen be suffered to be glazed.”&mdash;pp. 16, 17.</p>

<p>The writer, with equal wisdom, recommends the prohibition
of <i>stage coaches</i>, on account of their injuring the proprietors of
the inns on the road, by conveying the passengers too quickly,
and at too little expense to themselves. A pamphlet entitled
“The Naked Truth, in an Essay upon Trade,” published in
1696, informs us that&mdash;</p>

<p>“The commodities that we chiefly receive from the East
Indies are calicoes, muslins, Indian wrought silks, pepper, saltpetre,
indigo, &amp;c. The advantage of the Company is chiefly
in their muslins and Indian silks, (a great value in these commodities
being comprehended in a small bulk,) and these becoming
the general wear in England.”&mdash;p. 4. “Fashion is
truly termed a witch; the dearer and scarcer any commodity,
the more the mode; 30<i>s.</i> a yard for muslins, and only the
shadow of a commodity when procured.”&mdash;p. 11.</p>

<p>So sagacious and far-sighted an author as Daniel de Foe
(Author of Robinson Crusoe) did not escape the general notion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
that it was not merely injurious to the woollen and silk manufactures,
a but also a national evil, <span class="allsmcap">TO HAVE CLOTHING CHEAP
FROM ABROAD RATHER THAN TO MANUFACTURE IT DEAR
AT HOME</span>. In his <i>Weekly Review</i>, which contains so many
opinions on trade, credit, and currency far beyond the age, he
thus laments the large importations of Indian goods.</p>

<p>“The general fancy of the people runs upon East India goods
to that degree, that the <i>chintz</i> and <i>painted calicoes</i>, which
before were only made use of for carpets, quilts, &amp;c., and to
clothe children and ordinary people, become now the dress of
our ladies; and such is the power of a mode as we saw our
persons of quality dressed in stuffs which but a few years before
their chambermaids would have thought too ordinary for them:
the chintz was advanced from lying upon their floors to their
backs, from the foot-cloth to the petticoat; and even the queen
herself at this time was pleased to appear in China silks and
calico. Nor was this all, but it crept into our houses, closets,
and bed-chambers; curtains, cushions, chairs, and at last beds
themselves, were nothing but calicoes or Indian stuffs; and in
short, almost everything that used to be made of wool or silk,
relating either to the dress of the women or the furniture of our
houses, was supplied by the Indian trade.”</p>

<p>“Above half of the (woollen) manufacture was entirely lost,
half of the people scattered and ruined, and all this by the
intercourse of the East India trade.”&mdash;<i>Weekly Review</i>, <i>January</i>
31st, 1708.</p>

<p>However exaggerated and absurd De Foe’s estimate of the
injury caused to the woollen manufacture, as manifested by the
small value of the whole importations of Indian fabrics, at that
time, as well as (much more decisively) by the experience of
recent times, when the woollen manufacture has sustained the
incomparably more formidable competition of the English cotton
manufacture, it is evident from his testimony, and that of other
writers, that Indian calicoes, muslins, and chintzes, had become
common in England at the close of the seventeenth century.
De Foe’s complaint was not of an evil existing in 1708, when
he wrote, but of one a few years earlier; for he says in another
place, that the “<span class="smcap">Prohibition of Indian goods</span>” had “<span class="smcap">averted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
the ruin of English manufactures, and revived
their prosperity</span>.” This prohibition took place by the Act
11 and 12 William III. cap. 10., (1700,) which forbid the introduction
of Indian silks and printed calicoes for domestic use,
either as apparel or furniture, under a penalty of £200 on the
wearer or seller, and as this Act did not prevent the continued
use of the goods, which were probably smuggled from the continent
of Europe, other Acts for the same purpose were passed
at a later date.</p>

<p>A volume published in the year 1728, entitled “A Plan of
the English Commerce,” shows that the evil of a consumption
of Indian manufactures still prevailed, and that it was ascribed
to a cause for which the writer saw no remedy, namely, the <i>will
of the ladies</i>, or, in his own words, their “<i>passion for their
fashion</i>.” The other countries of Europe are represented as
equally suffering from Indian competition and <i>female perverseness</i>,
and as attempting in the same way to find a remedy in
legislative prohibition. Holland was an honorable exception.
The author says&mdash;</p>

<p>“The calicoes are sent from the Indies by land into Turkey,
by land and inland seas into Muscovy and Tartary, and about
by long-sea into Europe and America, till in general they are
become a grievance, and almost all the European nations but
the Dutch restrain and prohibit them.”&mdash;p. 180.</p>

<p>“Two things,” says the writer, “among us are too ungovernable,
viz. our <i>passions</i> and our <i>fashions</i>.</p>

<p>“Should I ask the ladies whether they would dress by law,
or clothe by act of parliament, they would ask me <i>whether
they were to be statute fools</i>, and to be made pageants and
pictures of?&mdash;whether the sex was to be set up for our jest, and
the parliament had nothing to do but make Indian queens of
them?&mdash;that they claim liberty as well as the men, and as they
expect to do what they please, and say what they please, so
they will wear what they please, and dress how they please.</p>

<p>“It is true that the liberty of the ladies, their <i>passion</i> for
their <i>fashion</i>, has been frequently injurious to the manufactures
of Great Britain, and is so still in some cases; but I do
not see so easy a remedy for that, as for some other things of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
the like nature. The ladies have suffered some little restraint
that way, as in the wearing East India silks, instead of English;
and calicoes and other things instead of worsted stuffs
and the like; and we do not see they are pleased with it.”&mdash;p.
253.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that not more than a century ago, the cotton
fabrics of India were so beautiful and cheap, that nearly all
the governments of Europe thought it necessary to prohibit
them, or to load them with heavy duties, <span class="allsmcap">IN ORDER TO PROTECT
THEIR OWN MANUFACTURES</span>. How surprising a revolution
has since taken place! The Indians have not lost
their former skill; but a power has arisen, which has robbed
them of their ancient ascendancy. The following document
furnishes superabundant proof how a manufacture which has
existed without a rival for thousands of years, is withering under
the competition of a power which is as it were but of yesterday:
it would be well if it did not also illustrate the very
different measure of protection and justice which governments
usually afford to their subjects at home, and to those of their
remote dependencies.</p>

<h4>PETITION OF NATIVES OF BENGAL, RELATIVE TO DUTIES
ON COTTON AND SILK.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“Calcutta, 1st. Sept. 1831.

<p>“<i>To the Right Honorable the Lords of His Majesty’s
Privy Council for Trade, &amp;c</i>.</p>

<p>“The humble Petition of the undersigned Manufacturers
and Dealers in <i>Cotton</i> and <i>Silk Piece-goods</i>, the fabrics of
Bengal;</p>

<p>“Sheweth&mdash;That of late years your Petitioners have found
their business nearly superseded by the introduction of the fabrics
of Great Britain into Bengal, the importation of which
augments every year, to the great prejudice of the native manufactures.</p>

<p>“That the fabrics of Great Britain are consumed in Bengal,
without any duties being levied thereon to protect the native
fabrics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
“That the fabrics of Bengal are charged with the following
duties when they are used in Great Britain&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“On manufactured cottons, 10 per cent.</p>
<p>“On manufactured silks, 24 per cent.</p>
</div>

<p>“Your Petitioners most humbly implore your Lordships’ consideration
of these circumstances, and they feel confident that
no disposition exists in England to shut the door against the
industry of any part of the inhabitants of this great empire.</p>

<p>“They therefore pray to be admitted to the privilege of British
subjects, and humbly entreat your Lordships to allow the
cotton and silk fabrics of Bengal to be used in Great Britain
free of duty, <i>or at the same rate which may be charged on
British fabrics consumed in Bengal</i><a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>.</p>

<p>“Your Lordships must be aware of the immense advantages
the British manufacturers derive from their skill in constructing
and using machinery, which enables them to undersell the
unscientific manufacturers of Bengal in their own country: and,
although your Petitioners are not sanguine in expecting to
derive any great advantage from having their prayer granted,
their minds would feel gratified by such a manifestation of your
Lordships’ good will towards them; and such an instance of
justice to the natives of India would not fail to endear the
British government to them.</p>

<p>“They therefore confidently trust, that your Lordships’
righteous consideration will be extended to them as British
subjects, without exception of <i>sect</i>, <i>country</i>, or <i>color</i>.</p>

<p>“And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_463" href="#FNanchor_463" class="label">[463]</a> This reasonable request was not complied with, the duty on India cotton being
still 10 per cent. The extra duty of 3½<i>d.</i> per yard on printed cottons was
taken off when the excise duty on English prints was repealed, in 1831. English
cottons imported into India only pay a duty of 2½ per cent.</p>

<p>Dacca, notwithstanding its present insignificance as compared
with its former grandeur, may nevertheless still be classed
among second rate cities. It has a population of 150,000 inhabitants,
which is nearly a third more than the city of Baltimore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
contains. Some new brick dwellings have silently sprung
up here and there, it may also be observed, within the last few
years; and this city can now boast an Oil Mill driven by steam,
and an Iron Suspension Bridge. Three more steam engines
are in the course of erection<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>. On the whole, an increase may
be looked for, rather than the contrary, in the wealth, population,
and importance of the city of Dacca.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be curious to compare the gradual decrease of the
population, with the falling off of the manufacture of those
beautiful cotton fabrics, for which this city was once without a
rival in the world<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>. The first falling off in the Dacca trade,
took place so far back as 1801, previous to which the yearly
advances made by the East India Company, and private traders,
for Dacca muslins, were estimated at upwards of twenty-five
lacs of rupees<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>. In 1807, the Company s investment had fallen
to 595,900, and the private trade to about 560,200. In 1813,
the private trade did not exceed 205,950, and that of the Company
was scarcely more considerable. And in 1817, the English
commercial residency was altogether discontinued. The French
and Dutch factories had been abandoned many years before.
The division of labor was carried to a great extent in the manufacture
of fine muslins. In spinning the very fine thread, more
especially, a great degree of skill was attained. It was spun
with the fingers on a “<i>Takwa</i>,” or fine steel spindle, by young
women, who could only work during the early part of the
morning, while the dew was on the ground; for such was the
extreme tenuity of the fibre, that it would not bear manipulation
after the sun had risen. One retti of cotton could thus be
spun into a thread eighty cubits long; which was sold by the
spinners at one rupee, eight annas, per sicca weight. The
“Raffugars,” or <i>Darners</i>, were also particularly skilful. They
could <i>remove an entire thread from a piece of muslin</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
<i>replace it by one of a finer texture</i>. The cotton used for the
finest thread, was grown in the immediate neighborhood of
Dacca, more especially about Sunergong. Its fibre is too short,
however, to admit of its being worked up by any except that
most wonderful of all machines&mdash;the human hand. The art
of making the very fine muslin fabrics is now lost&mdash;and a pity
it is that it should be so.</p>

<p>In 1820, a resident of Dacca, on a special order received from
China, procured the manufacture of two pieces of muslin, each
ten yards long by one wide, and weighing ten and a half sicca
rupees.&mdash;The price of each piece was 100 sicca rupees. In
1822, the same individual received a second commission for two
similar pieces, from the same quarter; but the parties who had
supplied him on the former occasion had died in the mean time,
and he was unable to execute the commission.</p>

<p>The annual investment, called the “Malbus Khás,” for the
royal wardrobe at Delhi, absorbed a great part of the finest fabrics
in former times: the extreme beauty of some of these muslins,
was sufficiently indicated by the names they bore: such as,
“<i>Abrowan</i>,” running water; “<i>Siebnem</i>,” evening dew, &amp;c.
The cotton manufacture has not yet arrived at anything like
this perfection with us, and probably never will.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_467" href="#FNanchor_467" class="label">[467]</a> The manufacture of fine muslin, was attempted both in Lancashire and at
Glasgow, about the year 1780, with weft spun by the jenny. The attempt
failed, owing to the coarseness of the yarn. Even with Indian weft, muslins
could not be made to compete with those of the East. But when the mule was
brought into general use, in 1785, both weft and warp were produced sufficiently
fine for muslins; and so quickly did the weaver avail himself of the improvement in
the yarn, that no less than 500,000 pieces of muslin were manufactured in Great
Britain in the year 1787. In a “Report of the Select Committee of the Court
of Directors of the East India Company upon the subject of the Cotton Manufacture
of this Country,” made in the year 1793, it is said, that “<i>every shop offers
British muslins for sale equal in appearance, and of more elegant patterns
than those of India, for one-fourth, or perhaps more than one-third, less in
price</i>.” “Muslin began to be made nearly at the same time at Bolton, at Glasgow,
and at Paisley, each place adopting the peculiar description of fabric which
resembled most those goods it had been accustomed to manufacture; and, in
consequence of this judicious distribution at first, each place has continued to
maintain a superiority in the production of its own article. Jaconets, both coarse
and fine, but of a stout fabric, checked and striped muslins, and other articles of
the heavier description of this branch, are manufactured in Bolton, and its neighborhood.
Book, mull, and leno muslins, and jaconets of a lighter fabric than those
made in Lancashire, are manufactured in Glasgow. Sewed and tambored muslins
are almost exclusively made there and in Paisley.”&mdash;<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
Coarse cotton piece goods still continue to be manufactured
at Dacca, though from the extreme cheapness of English cloths,
it is not improbable that the native manufacture will be altogether
superseded ere long.</p>

<p>In 1823-4, cotton piece goods, mostly coarse, passed the
Dacca Custom House, to the value of 1,442,101. In 1829-30,
the value of the same export was 969,952 only. There was a
similar falling off in <i>silk</i> and <i>embroidered</i> goods during the
same period.</p>

<p>In the export of the articles of cotton yarn again, there has
been an increase. In 1813, the value was 4,480 rupees only;
whereas in 1821-22, it amounted to 39,319 rupees. From
that period it has, however, decreased; and in 1829-30, the
value of the native cotton yarn exported from Dacca, amounted
to 29,475 rupees only.</p>

<p>Annexed are two statements&mdash;one showing the comparative
prices of muslins now manufactured at Dacca, and of the same
description of cloth, the produce of British looms.&mdash;The other,
the comparative prices of Dacca cloths, manufactured from
yarn spun in the country, and from British cotton yarn.
These cannot fail to be interesting at the present moment, and
their general accuracy may be relied on.</p>

<p>The manufacture of cotton, as we have seen, was general in
India and had attained high excellence in the age of the first
Greek historian, <i>that is, in the fifth century before Christ</i>, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
which time it had already existed for an unknown period; yet
eighteen centuries more elapsed before it was introduced into
Italy or Constantinople, or even secured a footing in the neighboring
empire of China. Though so well suited to hot climates,
we have seen that cottons were known rather as a curiosity
than as a common article of dress in Egypt and Persia, five
centuries after the Greeks had heard of the “wool-bearing
trees” of India: in Egypt, as has been shown, the manufacture
never reached any considerable degree of excellence, and the
muslins worn by the higher classes have always been imported
from India<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>. In Spain the manufacture, after flourishing to
some degree, became nearly extinct. In Italy, Germany, and
Flanders, it had also a lingering and ignoble existence.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_468" href="#FNanchor_468" class="label">[468]</a> In Arabia and the neighboring countries, cottons and muslins came gradually
into use; and the manufacture was spread, by the commercial activity and enterprise
of the early followers of Mohammed, throughout the extended territories
subdued by their arms. “It is recorded of the fanatical Omar, the immediate
successor of the Arabian impostor, that he preached in a tattered cotton gown, torn
in <i>twelve</i> places; and of Ali, his contemporary, who assumed the caliphate after
him, that on the day of his inauguration, he went to the mosque dressed in a thin
cotton gown, tied round him with a girdle, a coarse turban on his head, his slippers
in one hand, and his bow in the other, instead of a walking staff.”&mdash;<i>Crichton’s
History of Arabia</i>, <i>vol.</i> i. <i>pp.</i> 397, 403.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of flax by any author occurs in the account
of the plague of hail, which devastated Lower Egypt,
Ex. ix. 31. The Hebrew term for flax in this and various
other passages of the old Testament is פשתה  ; the corresponding
word in the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic versions is כתנא
 Λίνον, LXX. Linum, <i>Jerome</i>.</p>

<p>In Isaiah xix. 9, according to King James’s Translators and
Bishop Lowth, mention is made of those that “<i>work in fine
flax</i>,” and which was one of the chief employments of the
Egyptians. According to Herodotus (ii. 37, 81.) the Egyptians
universally wore linen shirts, which were fringed at the bottom.
The fringe consisted of the <i>thrums</i>, or ends of the webs.
Thrums used for this purpose may be seen in the cloths which
are found in Egyptian mummies.</p>

<p>Besides the linen shirt the priests wore an upper garment of
linen, more especially when they officiated in the temples.
This garment was probably of the exact form of a modern
linen sheet. The distinction between the shirt and the sheet
worn over it, as well as the reason why linen was used for all
sacred purposes, is clearly expressed in the two following passages
from Apuleius and Jerome.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Etiamnè cuiquam mirum videri potest, cui sit ulla memoria religionis, hominem
tot mysteriis Deûm conscium, quædam sacrorum crepundia domi adversare, atque
ea lineo texto involvere, quod purissimum est rebus divinis velamentum? Quippe
lana, segnissimi corporis excrementum, pecori detracta, jam inde Orphei et Pythagoræ
scitis, profanus vestitus est. Sed enim mundissima lini seges, inter optimas
fruges terrâ exorta, non modò indutui et amictui sanctissimis Ægyptiorum sacerdotibus,
sed opertui quoque in rebus sacris usurpatur.</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Apuleii Apolog. p. 64. ed. Pricæi.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Can any one impressed with a sense of religion wonder, that a man who has
been made acquainted with so many mysteries of the gods, should keep at home
certain sacred emblems and wrap them in a linen cloth, the purest covering for
divine objects? For wool, the excretion of a sluggish body, taken from sheep,
was deemed a profane attire even according to the early tenets of Orpheus and
Pythagoras. But flax, that cleanest and best production of the field, is used, not
only for the inner and outer clothing of the most holy priests of the Egyptians,
but also for covering sacred objects.&mdash;<i>Yates’s Translation.</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Indutus</i> was the putting on of the <i>inner</i>, amictus of the
<i>outer</i> garment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vestibus lineis utuntur Ægyptii sacerdotes non solum extrinsecus, sed et intrinsecus.&mdash;<i>Hieron.

<p>The Egyptian priests use linen garments, not only without, but also within.</p>
</div>

<p>Plutarch says<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>, that the priests of Isis wore linen on account
of its purity, and he remarks how absurd and inconsistent would
have been their conduct, if they had carefully plucked the
hairs from their own bodies, and yet clothed themselves in
wool, which is the hair of sheep. He also mentions the opinion
of some who thought that flax was used for clothing, because
the <i>color of its blossom resembles the etherial blue which
surrounds the world</i>; and he states, that the priests of Isis
were also buried in their sacred vestments. According to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
Strabo, Panopolis was an ancient seat of the linen manufacture<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>.</p>

<p>Celsius in his Hierobotanicon (<i>vol.</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 287-291.), and Forster
in his treatise De Bysso Antiquorum (<i>p.</i> 65-68.) have
quoted other passages from ancient authors, which concur to
show the abundance and excellence of the flax grown anciently
in Lower Egypt, and more particularly in the vicinity of Pelusium,
the general employment of it among the inhabitants for
clothing, and the exclusive use of linen cloth for the garments
of the priesthood and for other sacred purposes, and especially
for the worship of Isis and Osiris. From the same authorities
we learn, that the Egyptian flax and the cloth woven from it
were shipped in great quantities to all the ports of the Mediterranean<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_471" href="#FNanchor_471" class="label">[471]</a> “Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and <i>linen yarn</i>”
(טקוח): 1 Kings x. 28. 2 Chron. i. 16.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In connection with these statements the reader is referred to
what has already been advanced (See Part Second, <a href="#Chapter2_I">Chap. I.</a>)
on the use of wool for clothing by the Egyptians; and it may
be also observed, that when we find it stated by ancient authors,
that the priests wore linen only, the term ought not to be
so strictly understood as to exclude the use of cotton, which
would probably be considered equally pure and equally adapted
for sacred purposes with linen, and which was brought in ancient
times from India to Egypt; and the term <i>linum</i> was undoubtedly
often employed in so general a sense as to include
cotton.</p>

<p>These testimonies of ancient authors are confirmed in a very
remarkable manner by existing monuments. The paintings
in the Grotto of El Kab represent among other scenes a field
of corn and a crop of flax, the latter distinguished by its inferior
height, by its round capsules, and by being pulled up by
the roots instead of being reaped. The mode of binding the
flax in bundles is also exhibited, and the separation of the
“bolls,” or capsules, containing the lin-seed, from the stalk,
by the use of a comb, or “ripple.” (<i>See Description de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
l’Egypte: Antiquités; Planches, tome</i> i. <i>pl.</i> 68. <i>and the
Plates to Hamilton’s Ægyptiaca</i>, xxiii.)</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a> is inserted so much of the painting as relates to
our present subject. Five persons are employed in plucking up
the flax by the roots, viz., four men and one woman. The
woman wears a shift reaching to her ancles, but <i>transparent</i><a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>.
The four men wear shirts which reach to their knees, and are
not transparent. Another man binds the flax into sheaves: a
sixth carries it to a distance: and a seventh separates the seed
from the stem by means of a four-toothed ripple. The back of
the ripple rests on the ground; its teeth being raised to the
proper elevation by a prop, as shown in the drawing. The man
sets his foot upon the back to keep the instrument firm, and,
taking hold of a bunch of flax near the root, draws it through
the comb. This method is now employed in Europe. At the
left-hand corner of the Plate lies a bundle of flax stript of its
capsules, and underneath the ripple is the heap of seed which
has been separated from the stem.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_472" href="#FNanchor_472" class="label">[472]</a> This circumstance is adapted to illustrate the mention of “transparent garments”
in Isaiah iii. 23. Lowth’s Translation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Evidence equally decisive is presented in the innumerable
mummies, the fabrication of successive ages through a period
of more than two thousand years, which are found in the catacombs
of Egypt. It is indeed disputed, whether the cloth in
which they are enveloped is linen or cotton.</p>

<p>It was believed to be linen by all writers previous to Rouelle.
More especially, this opinion was advanced by the learned
traveller and antiquary, Professor John Greaves, in his Pyramidographia,
published A. D. 1646. He speaks of the “linen
shroud” of a mummy, which he opened, and he says, “The
ribbands” (<i>or fillets</i>) “by what I observed, were of linen, which
was the habit also of the Egyptian priests.” He adds, “of
these ribbands I have seen some so <i>strong</i> and <i>perfect</i> as if
they had been made but yesterday.”</p>

<p>Rouelle’s dissertation on Mummies is published in the <i>Mémoires
de l’Académie R. des Sciences</i> for the year 1750. He
there asserts (<i>p.</i> 150), that the cloth of every mummy which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
he had an opportunity of examining, even that of embalmed
birds, was cotton.</p>

<p>Dr. Hadley, however, who wrote a few years after Rouelle
(<i>Phil. Transactions for 1764, vol. 54.</i>), seems to adhere to the
old opinion. He calls the cloth of the mummy, which he examined,
“linen.” He says, it was in fillets of different breadths,
but the greater part 1½ inches broad. “They were torn longitudinally;
those few that had a selvage, having it on one side
only.”</p>

<p>But the opinion of Rouelle received a strong support from
Dr. John Reinhold Forster, to whom it appeared at first almost
incredible, although he afterwards supported it in the most
decided manner. He determined to take the first opportunity
of settling the question by the inspection of mummies, and
examined those in the British Museum, accompanied by Dr.
Solander. Both of these learned and acute inquirers were convinced,
that the cloth was cotton, deriving this opinion from the
inspection of all those specimens, which were sufficiently free
from gum, paint, and resins, to enable them to judge<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>. Larcher
informs us, that he remarked the same thing in these mummies
in 1752, when he was accompanied by Dr. Maty<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>. It is to be
observed, however, that neither Larcher, Rouelle, nor Forster
mentions the criterion which he employed to distinguish linen
from cotton. They probably formed their opinion only from its
apparent softness, its want of lustre, or some other quality, which
might belong to linen no less than to cotton, and which therefore
could be no certain mark of distinction.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The opinion of Larcher, Rouelle, and Forster appears to have
been generally adopted. In particular we find it embraced by
Blumenbach, who in the Philosophical Transactions for 1794
speaks of the “cotton bandages” of two of the small mummies,
which he opened in London<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>. In his <i>Beiträge (i. e. Contributions
to Natural History, 2nd part, p. 73, Göttingen</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
1811) he says, he is more firmly convinced than ever, that the
cloth is universally cotton. He assigns also his reasons in the
following terms. “I ground this my conviction far less on my
own views than on the assurance of such persons as I have
questioned on the subject, and whose judgment in this matter I
deem incomparably superior to my own or to that of any other
scholar, namely, of ladies, dealers in cotton and linen cloth,
weavers and the like.” He also refers to the cultivation of
cotton in Egypt, which he assumes probably on the authority
of Forster; and to the fable of Isis enveloping in “cotton”
cloth the collected limbs of her husband Osiris, who had been
torn in pieces by Typhon. The latter arguments are founded
on the supposition, that the ancient term <i>Byssus</i> meant cotton,
and not linen. But the question as to its meaning must in
part be decided, as we shall see hereafter, by previously settling
the present question as to the materials of the mummy cloth.
The opinion of ladies, tradesmen, and manufacturers, though
it may be better than that of the most learned man, if derived
from mere touch and inspection, is quite insufficient to decide
the question. If those whom Blumenbach consulted thought
that the cloth was always cotton, many others of equal experience
and discernment have given an opposite judgment; and
the fact is, that linen cloth, which has been long worn and often
washed, as is the case with a great proportion of the mummy
cloth, and which is either ragged or loose in its texture, cannot
be distinguished from cotton by the unassisted use of the external
senses.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Relying, however, on the same evidence of ocular inspection,
another distinguished author, who travelled in Egypt and published
his remarks about the same time, says, “As to the
circumstance of cotton cloths having been exclusively used in
the above process, an inspection of the mummies is sufficient
evidence of the fact<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>.”</p>

<p>M. Jomard, one of the authors of the great French work on

He concluded, that both linen and cotton were employed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
in the bandages of mummies, grounding his opinion partly on
their appearance and touch, and partly on the testimony of
Herodotus, whom he misinterpreted in the manner, which will

<p>An important paper on the same subject appeared in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1825. In this Dr. A. B. Granville
describes a mummy, which he opened. He dwells more
particularly on the circumstances, which have reference to anatomical
and surgical considerations, and expresses very strongly
his admiration of the skill and neatness employed in folding the
cloth, so as to present an example of every kind of bandage
used by modern surgeons, and to exhibit it in the most perfect
manner.</p>

<p>The passages which are connected with the present inquiry,
will be quoted at length. Dr. Granville observes (<i>p. 272.</i>),</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The principal rollers appear to be made of a very compact, yet elastic linen,
some of them from four to five yards in length, without any stitch or seam in any
part of them. There were also some large square pieces thrown around the head,
thorax, and abdomen, of a less elastic texture. These pieces were found to alternate
with the complete swathing of the whole body. They occurred four distinct
times; while the bandaging, with rollers and other fasciæ, was repeated, at least,
twenty times. The numerous bandages, by which the mummy was thus enveloped,
were themselves wholly covered by a roller 3½ inches wide and 11 yards
long, which after making a few turns around both feet, ascended in graceful spirals
to the head, whence descending again as far as the breast, it was fixed there.
The termination of this outer roller is remarkable for the loose threads hanging
from it in the shape of a fringe and for certain traces of characters imprinted on
it similar to those described and delineated by Jomard in the <i>Description de
l’Egypte</i>. One or two of these characters have corroded the linen, leaving the
perforated traces of their form.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Granville gives a fac-simile of these characters, and in
the same Plate he represents the exact appearance of the external
rolls of cloth on the mummy. He then says (<i>p.</i> 274.),</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have satisfied myself, that both cotton and linen have been employed in the
preparation of our mummy, although Herodotus mentions only cotton (<i>byssus</i>)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
as the material used for the purpose. Most mummies have been described as
wholly enveloped in linen cloth, and some persons are disposed to doubt the existence
of cotton cloth in any, not excepting in the one now under consideration.</p>

<p>But with respect to the last point, a simple experiment has, I think, set the
question at rest. If the surface of old linen, and of old cotton cloth be rubbed
briskly and for some minutes with a rounded piece of glass or ivory, after being
washed and freed from all extraneous matter, the former will be found to have
acquired considerable lustre; while the latter will present no other difference than
that of having the threads flattened by the operation. By means of this test I
selected several pieces of cotton cloth from among the many bandages of our
mummy, which I submitted to the inspection of an experienced manufacturer,
who declared them to be of that material.</p>

</div>

<p>Besides the appeal to the senses of “an experienced manufacturer,”
Dr. Granville here proposes a new test, that of rubbing
in the manner described. But, although cotton cloth in
all circumstances has less lustre than linen, still this cannot be
considered a satisfactory criterion.</p>

<p>The ingenious John Howell of Edinburgh<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> paid some attention
to this question, having a few years since obtained and
opened a valuable mummy. He and the friends, whom he
consulted, and who were <i>weavers</i> and other persons of <i>practical</i>
experience, most of them thought that the cloth was altogether
linen: some however thought that certain specimens of
it were cotton.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This curious and important question was at length decisively
settled by means of microscopic observations instituted by James
Thomson, Esq. F. R. S. of Clitheroe, one of the most observant
and experienced cotton-manufacturers in Great Britain.
He obtained about 400 specimens of mummy cloth, and employed
Mr. Bauer of Kew to examine them with his microscopes.
By the same method the structure and appearance of the ultimate
fibres of modern cotton and flax were ascertained; and
were found to be so distinct that there was no difficulty in deciding
upon the ancient specimens, and it was also found that
they were universally linen. About twelve years after Mr.
Thomson had commenced his researches he published the results
of them in the Philosophical Magazine<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>, and he has accompanied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
them with a Plate exhibiting the obvious difference
between the two classes of objects. The ultimate fibre of cotton
is a transparent tube without joints, flattened so that its inward
surfaces are in contact along its axis, and also twisted spirally
round its axis (See A. <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a>): that of flax is a transparent
tube jointed like a cane, and not flattened nor spirally twisted
(See B. <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a>). To show the difference two specimens of
the fibres of cotton, and two of the fibres of mummy cloth are
exhibited, all of the specimens being one hundredth of an inch
long, and magnified 400 times in each dimension. Any person,
even with a microscope of moderate power, may discern
the difference between the two kinds of fibres, though not so
minutely and exactly as in the figures of Mr. Bauer.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The difference, here pointed out, will explain why linen has
greater lustre than cotton: it is no doubt because in linen the
lucid surfaces are much larger. The same circumstance may
also explain the different effect of linen and cotton upon the
health and feelings of those who wear them (See Part Third,
<a href="#Chapter3_I">Chap. I.</a>). Every linen thread presents only the sides of
cylinders: that of cotton, on the other hand, is surrounded by
an innumerable multitude of exceedingly minute edges.</p>

<p>Mr. Pettigrew, in his “History of Egyptian Mummies”
(<i>London</i> 1834, <i>p.</i> 95.), expresses the opinion that the bandages
are principally of cotton, though occasionally of linen. He has
since arrived at the conclusion that they are all of linen: and
his opinion appears to be established on the following evidence,
which he gives in a note to the above mentioned work (<i>p.</i> 91.).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Ure has been so good as to make known to me that which I conceive to
be the most satisfactory test of the absolute nature of flax and cotton, and in the
course of his microscopic researches on the structure of textile fibres he has succeeded
in determining their distinctive characters. From a most precise and accurate
examination of these substances he has been able to draw the following
statement:&mdash;The filaments of flax have a glassy lustre when viewed by day-light
in a good microscope, and a cylindrical form, which is very rarely flattened.
Their diameter is about the two-thousandth part of an inch. They break transversely
with a smooth surface, like a tube of glass cut with a file. A line of light
distinguishes their axis, with a deep shading on one side only, or on both sides,
according to the direction in which the incident rays fall on the filaments.</p>

<p>The filaments of cotton are almost never true cylinders, but are more or less
flattened and tortuous; so that when viewed under the microscope they appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
in one part like a riband from the one-thousandth to the twelve-hundredth part
of an inch broad, and in another like a sharp edge or narrow line. They have a
pearly translucency in the middle space, with a dark narrow border at each side,
like a hem. When broken across, the fracture is fibrous or pointed. Mummy
cloth, tried by these criteria in the microscope, appears to be composed both in its
warp and woof-yarns of flax, and not of cotton. A great variety of the swathing
fillets have been examined with an excellent achromatic microscope, and they
have all evinced the absence of cotton filaments.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Wilkinson considers the observations of Dr. Ure, and
Mr. Bauer as decisive of the question<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>With regard to the evidence from mummies it should be
further remarked, that, as they are partly wrapped in old linen
(shirts, napkins, and other articles of clothing and domestic furniture
being found with the long fillets and the entire webs),
they prove the general application of linen in Egypt to all the
purposes of ordinary life.</p>

<p>Even to the present day flax continues to be a most important
article of cultivation and trade in Egypt<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>. The climate
and soil are so favorable, that it there grows to a height, which
it never reaches in Europe. It must no doubt, become coarser
in proportion to its size, and this circumstance may account for
the use of it in ancient times for all those purposes, for which
we employ hemp, as for making nets, ropes, and sail-cloth.
The fine linen of the ancient Egyptians must have been
made from flax of lower growth and with thinner stems; and
the mummies testify, that they made cloth of the finest as well
as of the coarsest texture.</p>

<p>The following remark of Hasselquist respecting the <i>soft</i> and
<i>loose</i> texture of the linen made in Egypt in his time agrees remarkably
with the appearance of that found in mummies.
“The Egyptian linen is not so thick,” says he, “as the European,
being softer and of a looser texture; for which reason
it lasts longer and does not wear out so soon as ours, which frequently
wears out the faster on account of its stiffness.” He
also observes, “The common people in Egypt are clothed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
linen only, dyed blue with <i>indigo</i>; but those of better fortune
have a black cloak over their linen shirt.”</p>

<p>The coarse linen of the Ancient Egyptians was called Φώσων.
It was made of thick flax, and was used for towels (σουδάρια, <i>Julius
Pollux</i>, vii. <i>c.</i> 16.), and for sails (Φώσσωνας, <i>Lycophron</i>, <i>v.</i>
26.)<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>. Φώσων may be translated <i>canvass</i>, or sail-cloth.</p>

<p>Fine linen, on the other hand, was called Ὀθόνη. This term,
as well as the preceding, was in all probability an Egyptian
word, adopted by the Greeks to denote the commodity, to which
the Egyptians themselves applied it. It seems to correspond,
as Salmasius<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>, Celsius<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>, Forster<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>, and Jablonski<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> have observed,
to the אטון מצריס “Fine linen of Egypt,” in Proverbs vii. 16.
For אטון, put into Greek letters and with Greek terminations,
becomes ὀθόνη and ὀθόνιον. Hesychius states, no doubt correctly,
that ὀθόνη was applied by the Greeks to any fine and thin cloth,
though not of linen<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>. But this was in later times and by a
general and secondary application of the term.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_488" href="#FNanchor_488" class="label">[488]</a> The ancient Scholia (published by Mai and Butmann) on Od. η. 107, state
that ὀθόναι were made both of flax and of wool. The silks of India are called
 Ὀθόναι σηρικὰ.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It appears also that in later times ὀθόνη was not restricted to fine
linen. It is used for <i>a sail</i> by Achilles Tatius in describing a
storm (l. iii.), and by the Scholiast on Homer, <i>Il.</i> σ.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the preceding remarks, the ὀθόναι mentioned in
the two passages of the Iliad may be supposed to have been
procured from Egypt. Helen, when she goes to meet the senators
of Ilium at the Scæan Gate, wraps herself in a white
sheet of fine linen (Il. γ. 141.). The women, dancing on the
shield of Achilles (Il. σ. 595.), wear <i>thin sheets</i>. These thin
sheets must be supposed to have been worn as shawls, or girt
about the bodies of the dancers. Helen would wear hers so as
to veil her whole person agreeably to the representation of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
lady, whom Paulus Silentiarius addresses in the following
line, written evidently with Homer’s Helen before his mind:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You conceal your flowing locks with a snow-white sheet.&mdash;<i>Brunck</i>, <i>Analecta</i>,
<i>vol.</i> iii. <i>p.</i> 81.</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps even the sheets, spread for Phœnix to lie upon in the
tent of Achilles, and for Ulysses on his return to Ithica from
the country of the Phæacians<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>, though not called by the Egyptian
name, should be supposed to have been made in Egypt.
In the time of Homer (900 B. C.) the use of linen cloth was
certainly rare among the Greeks; the manufacture of it was
perhaps as yet unknown to them.</p>

<p>The term Σινδών (<i>Sindon</i>), was used to denote linen cloth still
more extensively than ὀθόνη, inasmuch as it occurs both in Greek
and Latin authors<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>. According to Julius Pollux this also was
a word of Egyptian origin, and Coptic scholars inform us that
it is found in the modern <i>Shento</i>, which has the same signification<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Serapion was called Sindonites, because he always wore
linen (Palladii <i>Hist. Lausiaca</i>, p. 172). He was an Egyptian,
and retained the custom of his native country.</p>

<p>Although Σινδών originally denoted linen, we find it applied,
like Ὀθόνη, to cotton cloth likewise; and although both of these
terms probably denoted at first those linen cloths only, and especially
the finer kinds of them, which were made in Egypt,
yet as the manufacture of linen extends itself into other countries,
and the exports of India were added to those of Egypt,
all varieties either of linen or cotton cloth, wherever woven,
were designated by the Egyptian names Ὀθόνη and Σινδών.</p>

<p>Another term, which is probably of Egyptian origin, and
therefore requires explanation here, is the term Βύσσος or Byssus.
Vossius (<i>Etymol.</i> L. <i>Lat.</i> v. <i>Byssus</i>) thinks it was, as Pollux
and Isidore assert, a fine, white, soft flax, and that the cloth
made from it was like the modern cambric: “Similis fuisse
videtur lino isti, quod vulgo <i>Cameracense</i> appellamus.” Celsius,
in his Hierobotanicon (<i>vol.</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 173.), gives the same explanation.
This was indeed the general opinion of learned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
men, until J. R. Forster advanced the position, that <i>Byssus was
cotton</i>. A careful examination of the question confirms the
correctness of the old opinions, and for the following reasons.</p>

<p>I. The earliest author, who uses the term, is Æschylus. He
represents Antigone wearing a shawl or sheet of fine flax<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>. In
the Bacchæ of Euripides (<i>l.</i> 776.) the same garment, which
was distinctive of the female sex, is introduced under the same
denomination. We cannot suppose, that dramatic writers
would mention in plays addressed to a general audience clothing
of any material with which they were not familiarly acquainted.
But the Greeks in the time of Æschylus and Euripides
knew little or nothing of cotton. They had, however,
been long supplied with fine linen from Egypt and Phœnice;
and the βύσσινον πέπλωμα of Antigone is the same article of female
attire with the ἀργενναὶ ὀθόναι of Helen, described by Homer. Indeed
Æschylus himself in two other passages calls the same
garment linen. In the Coephoræ (<i>l.</i> 25, 26.) the expressions,
 Λινόφθοροι δ’ ὑφασμάτων λακίδες and Πρόστερνοι στολμοὶ πέπλων, describe the
rents, expressive of sorrow, which were made in the linen veil
or shawl (πέπλος) of an Oriental woman. In the Supplices (<i>l.</i>
120.) the leader of the chorus says, she often tears her linen,
or her <i>Sidonian veil</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>II. The next author in point of time, and one of the first in
point of importance, is Herodotus. In his account of the mode
of making mummies, he says (<i>l.</i> ii. <i>c.</i> 86.) the embalmed body
was enveloped in cotton. But the fillets or bandages of the
mummies are proved by microscopic observations to be universally
linen; at least all the specimens have been found to be
linen, which have been submitted to this, the only decisive test.</p>

<p>III. Herodotus also states (vii. 181.), that a man, wounded in
an engagement, had his torn limbs bound σινδόνος βυσσίνης τελαμῶσι.
Now, supposing that the persons concerned had their choice
between linen and cotton, there can be no doubt that they
would choose linen as most suitable for such a purpose. Cotton,
when applied to wounds, irritates them. Julius Pollux mentions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
(<i>l.</i> iv. <i>c.</i> 20. 181.; <i>l.</i> vii. <i>c.</i> 16. <i>and</i> 25. 72.) these bandages
as used in surgery. The same fillets, which were used to
swathe dead bodies, were also adapted for surgical purposes.
Hence a Greek Epigram (<i>Brunck</i>, <i>An.</i> iii. 169.) represents a
surgeon and an undertaker <span class="allsmcap">AS LEAGUING TO ASSIST EACH
OTHER IN BUSINESS</span>. The undertaker supplies the surgeon
with bandages stolen from the dead bodies, and the surgeon in
return sends his patients to the undertaker!</p>

<p>IV. Diodorus Siculus (<i>l.</i> i. § 85. <i>tom.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 96.) records a tradition,
that Isis put the limbs of Osiris into a wooden cow, covered
with Byssina. No reason can be imagined, why cotton
should have been used for such a purpose; whereas the use of
fine linen to cover the hallowed remains was in perfect accordance
with all the ideas and practices of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>V. Plutarch, in his Treatise de Iside et Osiride (<i>Opp.</i> <i>ed.
Stephani</i>, 1572, <i>vol.</i> iv. <i>p.</i> 653.) says, that the priests enveloped
the gilded bull, which represented Osiris, in a black sheet of
Byssus. Now nothing can appear more probable, than that
the Egyptians would employ for this purpose the same kind of
cloth, which they always applied to sacred uses; and in addition
to all the other evidence before referred to, we find Plutarch
in this same treatise expressly mentioning the linen garments
of the priesthood, and stating, that the priests were entombed
in them after death, a fact verified at the present day by the
examination of the bodies of priests found in the catacombs.</p>

<p>VI. The magnificent ship, constructed for Ptolemy Philopator,
which is described at length in Athenæus, had a sail of the
fine linen of Egypt<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. It is not probable, that in a vessel, every
part of which was made of the best and most suitable materials,
the sail would be of cotton. Moreover Hermippus describes
Egypt as affording the chief supply of sails for all parts
of the world<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>: and Ezekiel represents the Tyrians as obtaining
cloth from Egypt for the sails and pendants of their ships<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>.</p>

<p>VII. It is recorded in the Rosetta Inscription (<i>l.</i> 17, 18.), that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
Ptolemy Epiphanes remitted two parts of the fine linen cloths,
which were manufactured in the temples for the king’s palace;
and (<i>l.</i> 29.) that he also remitted a tax on those, which were
not made for the king’s palace. Thus in an original and contemporary
monument we read, that Ὀθόνια βύσσινα were at a particular
time manufactured in Egypt. But we have no reason
to believe, that cotton was then manufactured in Egypt at all,
whereas linen cloth was made in immense quantities.</p>

<p>VIII. Philo, who lived at Alexandria, and could not be ignorant
upon the subject, plainly uses Βύσσος to mean flax. He
says, the Jewish High-Priest wore a linen garment, made of the
purest <i>Byssus</i>, which was a symbol of firmness, incorruption,
and of the clearest splendor, since <i>fine linen</i> is most difficult to
tear, is made of nothing mortal, and becomes brighter and more
resembling light, the more it is cleansed by washing<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>.</p>

<p>Here we may notice the tenacity of the cloth found in
Egyptian mummies. A great part of it is quite rotten; and its
tender and fragile state is to be accounted for, not only from its
great antiquity and exposure to moisture, but from the circumstance,
that much of it was old and worn, when first applied to
the purpose of swathing dead bodies. Nevertheless pieces are
found of great strength and durability.</p>

<p>Hans Jac. Amman, who visited the catacombs of Sakara in
1613, found the bandages so strong, that he was obliged to cut
them with scissors<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>. Professor Greaves<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> and Lord Sandwich
found them as firm <i>as if they were just taken from the loom</i>.
Abdollatiph, who visited Egypt A. D. 1200, mentions that the
Arabs employed the mummy cloth to make garments<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>. Much
more recently the same practice has been attested as coming
under his observation by Seetzen<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>. Caillaud discovered in the
mummy, which he opened, several <i>napkins</i> in such a state of
preservation, that he took a fancy to use one. He had it washed
eight times without any perceptible injury. “With a sort
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
of veneration,” says he, “I unfolded every day this venerable
linen, which had been woven more than 1700 years.” (<i>Voyage
à Meroe et au Fleuve Blanc.</i>)</p>

<p>IX. According to Josephus the Jewish priests wore drawers
of spun flax, and over the drawers a shirt. He calls a garment
made of Βύσσος a <i>linen</i> garment. It had <i>flowers woven into it,
which were of three different substances</i><a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. He soon after
mentions the same materials <i>as used for making the curtains
of the tabernacle</i>. In all these instances the figures or ornaments
<i>were of splendid colors upon a ground of white linen</i>.
We have no reason to believe, that either the Egyptians or the
Israelites in the time of Moses knew anything of cotton: so
that, if Josephus gives a true account, Βύσσος must have denoted
a kind of flax.</p>

<p>The shirt of the High Priest of the Jews was probably like that worn in the
worship of Isis, which was of Byssus, <i>but adorned with flowers</i>, “Byssina, sed

</div>
</div>

<p>X. Jerome on Ezekiel xxvii. says, “Byssus grows principally
in Egypt” (<i>Byssus in Ægypto quàm maximè nascitur</i>).
Of the celebrity of the Egyptian flax we have the most abundant
proofs; but, if by <i>Byssus</i> Jerome meant cotton, he here
committed a strange mistake; for, supposing cotton to have
grown at all in Egypt, it certainly grew far more abundantly in
other countries, and of this fact he could scarcely be ignorant.</p>

<p>XI. Martianus Capella plainly distinguishes between that
substance and <i>Byssus</i><a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>. He seems to have considered cotton
as an Indian, Byssus as an Egyptian product. He certainly
supposed, that they were not the same thing.</p>

<p>XII. Isidorus Hispalensis expressly states, that <i>Byssus</i> was
a kind of flax, very white and soft.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Byssus genus est quoddam lini nimium candidi et mollissimi, quod Græci papatem

genus quoddam lini byssum esse existiment.&mdash;<i>Ibid. c.</i> 22.</p>
</div>

<p>Forster conjectures (<i>p.</i> 4.) that for <i>genus quoddam lini</i> we
should read <i>genus quoddam lanæ</i>, and conceives <i>tree</i>-wool (as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
Pollux and some others call it), i. e. cotton, to be intended. His
conjecture seems probable. The remark of Isidore intimates,
that in his time it had already been a matter of dispute whether
Byssus was a kind of flax or something else.</p>

<p>XIII. Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, testifies to the great strength
of the threads of Byssus.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Vossius also quotes the authority of Jerome and Eucherius
to prove the great tenacity of Byssus. But, if Byssus were
cotton, it certainly would not have been celebrated on that
account.</p>

<p>The arguments of Dr. J. R. Forster on the other side of the
question will now be considered. See his <i>Liber Singularis
de Bysso Antiquorum</i>, Lon. 1776, <i>p.</i> 11. 50.</p>

<p>I. His first argument is as follows. Julius Pollux says
(<i>l.</i> vii. <i>c.</i> 17.), that Βύσσος was “a kind of flax among the Indians.”
The Jewish rabbis indeed all explain the Hebrew שש
(Shesh), which in the Septuagint is always translated Βύσσος, as
signifying <i>flax</i>. But they use the term for flax in so loose and
general a way, that they may very properly be supposed to have
included cotton under it. In the same general sense we must
suppose λίνον to be used by Julius Pollux; and it is clear, that
he must have meant cotton, because cotton grows abundantly
in India, whereas flax was never known to grow in India at all.</p>

<p>In proof of this last assertion Forster refers to Osbeck’s Journal,
vol i. p. 383. He also appeals to a passage of Philostratus
(<i>Vita Apollonii</i>, <i>l.</i> ii. <i>c.</i> 20. <i>p.</i> 70, 71.), which has been quoted
in Part Third, p. 328., where that author certainly applies the
term in question to the cotton of India.</p>

<p>An answer to this argument, so far as it depends on the testimony
of Julius Pollux, was furnished by Olaus Celsius in his
Hierobotanicon, published in 1747, a work which Forster had
better have consulted, when he was writing a treatise expressly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
intended to ascertain the meaning of one of the botanical terms
employed in the <i>Scriptures</i>. The learned and accurate Swede
gives on good authority an emendation of the text of Pollux,
which entirely destroys the argument founded upon it by Forster
and those who agree with him. According to this reading
Pollux only asserts that Βύσσος is a kind of flax, without adding
that it grew among the Indians<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. In a separate Appendix (E.),
will be examined distinctly and fully the critical evidence for
the correct state of the passages of Pollux, which it may be
found necessary to cite. Pollux, in asserting that Byssus was
a kind of flax, coincides with all the other witnesses who have
been produced.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_504" href="#FNanchor_504" class="label">[504]</a> Celsii Hierobot. vol. ii. p. 171.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Forster is also exceedingly incorrect in his mode of reasoning
upon the passage of Pollux, supposing it to be accurate and
genuine. He argues, that Pollux must have meant cotton by
“<i>a kind of flax among the Indians</i>,” because real flax does
not grow in India at all; “In Indiâ verò linum non erat, nec
quidem nostrâ ætate linum reperitur in Indiâ, quod jam Osbeckius
in Itinerario ostendit, p. 383. vol. i. edit. Anglicæ.” The
“<i>English edition</i>” of Osbeck’s Voyage is a translation from
the German by Forster himself. In the page referred to we
find the following passage relative to flax, and no other:&mdash;“<i>Flax
is so rare a commodity in the East</i>, that many have
judged with great probability that the fine linen of the rich
man, Luke xvi. 19, was no more than our common linen.”
This sentence implies that flax grew in the East, though
rarely. Whether it grew in India, Osbeck does not inform us.
Dr. Wallich, who travelled in India, states that flax grows in
India, and that he remembered having seen there a whole field
blue with its flowers. It is cultivated principally for its seed,
from which oil is extracted, the stalks being thrown aside as
useless.</p>

<p>With respect to the passage from Philostratus, it is admitted,
that he uses Βύσσος to denote cotton. Besides its proper and
original sense, this word was occasionally used, as λίνον, ὀθόνη,
<i>Sindon</i>, <i>Carbasus</i>, and many others were, in a looser and more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
general application. But the use of the term in this manner
by a single writer, or even, if they could be produced, by several
writers of so late an age as Philostratus, would be of little
weight in opposition to the evidence, which has been brought
forward to prove, that Βύσσος properly meant flax only.</p>

<p>II. Forster produces a passage from the Eliaca of Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
from which he argues, that βύσσος was not flax, because Pausanias
here distinguishes it from flax as well as from hemp.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_505" href="#FNanchor_505" class="label">[505]</a> Paus. l. vi. cap. § 4.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>But we know, that all plants undergo great changes by cultivation
and in consequence of the varieties of soil and climate.
What can be more striking than the innumerable tulips derived
from the original yellow tulip of Turkey, or all the varieties of
pinks and carnations from a single species? To make all the
descriptions of cloth from the coarsest canvass or sail-cloth to
the most beautiful lawn or cambric, there must have been, as
there now are, great differences in the living plant. The best
explanation therefore of the language of Pausanias seems to be,
that he used λίνον to denote the common kind of flax, and βύσσος
to signify a finer variety<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>. In another passage, where he
speaks of the Elean Byssus, his language shows, that its peculiar
excellence consisted both in its fineness and in its beautiful
yellow color; for after expressing the admiration, to which this
substance was entitled, as growing nowhere else in Greece, he
says, that “in fineness it was not inferior to that of the Hebrews,
but was not equally yellow<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_506" href="#FNanchor_506" class="label">[506]</a> Pausanias also distinguishes between λίνον and βύσσος in his account of the
clothing of a reputed statue of Neptune, l. vi. c. 25. § 5. When flax is raised to
be manufactured into cambric and fine lawn, twice as much seed is sown in the
same space of ground. The plants then grow closer together; the stalks are
more delicate and slender; and the fibres of each plant are finer in proportion.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_507" href="#FNanchor_507" class="label">[507]</a> L. v. 5. § 2.</p>

<p>Others commend Byssus on account of its whiteness. See Philo. Apoc. xix. 14.
Themistius (Orat. p. 57. ed. Paris, 1684. p. 68. ed. Dindorfii, Lips. 1832.) saw at
Antioch “ancient letters wrapt <i>in white Byssus</i>.” These, he says, were brought
from Susa and Ecbatana.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It may further be remarked in opposition to the idea, that
 βύσσος meant cotton in these passages, that there is not the
slightest ground for supposing, that cotton was cultivated either
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
in Elis or in any other part of Europe so early as the time of
Pausanias, nor indeed until a comparatively recent age.</p>

<p>III. Forster (<i>p.</i> 69-71.) considers the testimony of Herodotus,
that the embalmed bodies of the dead were wrapt in fillets
of Byssus, as decisive in favor of his opinion, because those fillets
are found on examination to be all cotton. It is presumed
that the preceding testimony, proves that so far as they have
been examined, in the only way which can settle the dispute,
they are found universally to be linen.</p>

<p>Of Forster’s <i>celebrated</i> work it may be observed in general,
<i>that he rather from the very beginning assumes his point,
than endeavors to prove it</i>. He continually speaks of it as
<i>demonstrated</i>. Nevertheless the only arguments which can be
found in his book, are those already stated. Little as these arguments
amount to in opposition to the evidence, which has
now been brought forward on the other side of the question, we
find that the most learned authors since Forster’s time, and especially
since the same opinion was embraced by Blumenbach,
have generally been content to adopt it. But, although such
eminent names as those of Porson<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>, Dr. Thomas Young<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>, Mr.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
produced, i. e. to prove that βύσσος meant <i>flax</i> and <i>not</i> cotton, as
those authors have supposed. Yet their evidence may be considered
as going all for nothing, because they express not their
own opinion formed by independent inquiry and investigation,
but merely the opinion which they have adopted from Forster
and Blumenbach.</p>

<p>There is, however, no reason to doubt, that Forster is right
in considering Βύσσος, or Byssus, as an Egyptian word with a
Greek or Latin termination. In the Septuagint version it is always
used as equivalent to the Hebrew שש (<i>Shesh</i> or <i>Ses</i>),
which according to the Hebrew Rabbis was a kind of flax, that
grew in Egypt only and was of the finest quality<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>. Another
term, used in the Pentateuch for linen cloth is בד (<i>bad</i>), which
seems to be nearly the same as שש . The Egyptian term שש or
בוץ (<i>buts</i>) is very seldom found in the Hebrew Scriptures, and
not until the intercourse became frequent between the Jews
and other oriental nations. But it is continually employed by
the Arabic, Persic, and Chaldee Translators, as equivalent to
the Hebrew terms שש and בד .</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The distinction between Βύσσος and the Egyptian terms formerly
explained is very obvious. Φώσων, Ὀθόνη, and Σινδών denoted
linen cloth; Βύσσος the plant, from which it was made.
Hence we so commonly find the adjective form Βύσσινος or Byssinus,
i. e. made of Byssus, as in Σινδὼν βύσσινη, Ὀθόνη βύσσινη, Ὀθόνια
βύσσινα, Στόλη βύσσινη, &amp;c., and this is agreeable to the remark of the
Patriarch Photius in his 192nd Epistle, Φυτὸν δὲ ἡ βύσσος, “Byssus
is a plant.”</p>

<p>Herodotus (ii. 105.), pointing out resemblances between the
Egyptians and the Colchians, says, they prepare their flax in
the same manner, and in a manner which is practiced by no other
nation. Xenophon directs, that nets should be made of flax from
the Phasis, or from Carthage<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>. Pollux (<i>l.</i> v. <i>cap.</i> 4. § 26.) says,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
that the flax for the same purpose should be either from those
countries, or from Egypt or Sardes. Callimachus (<i>Frag.</i> 265.)
mentions the flax of Colchis under the name of “the Colchian
halm.” Strabo (<i>l.</i> xi. § 17. <i>vol.</i> iv. <i>p.</i> 402. Tschuz.) testifies to the
celebrity of Colchis for the growth and manufacture of flax,
and says, that the linen of this country was exported to distant
places.</p>

<p>It seems still to maintain its ancient pre-eminence: Larcher
refers to Chardin (<i>tom.</i> i. <i>p.</i> 115.), as saying, that the Prince of
Mingrelia, a part of the ancient Colchis, paid in his time an
annual tribute of linen to the Turks.</p>

<p>That flax was extensively cultivated in Babylonia appears
from the testimony of Herodotus, who says (i. 195.), that the
Babylonians wore a linen shirt reaching to the feet; over that
a woollen shirt; and over that a white shawl. Strabo (<i>l.</i> xvi.
<i>cap.</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 739. <i>ed. Casaub.</i>) shows where these linen shirts
were chiefly made; for he informs us that <i>Borsippa</i>, a city of
Babylonia, sacred to Apollo and Diana, was a great place for
the manufacture of linen.</p>

<p>The cultivation of flax in the region of the Euphrates may
also be inferred from the use of the linen thorax, as attested by
Xenophon (<i>Cyropedia</i>, vi. 4. 2.).</p>

<p>From Joshua ii. 6. we have evidence, that flax was cultivated
in Palestine near the Jordan. Rahab concealed the two Hebrew
spies (according to the common English version) “with
the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.”
According to the Septuagint translation, “the stalks of flax”
were not merely “laid in order,” but “stacked.” Josephus says,
<i>she was drying the bundles</i>. The Chaldee Paraphrast Onkelos
also uses the expression מעוני כחנא, <i>bundles of flax</i>.
Agreeably to these explanations, the history must be understood
as implying, that the stalks of flax, tied into bundles, as represented
in the painting at El Kab<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>, were stacked, probably crossways,
upon the flat roof of Ahab’s house, so as to allow the
wind to blow through and dry them.</p>

<p>Other passages, referring to the use of flax for weaving in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>

are four times mentioned in opposition to woollen.</p>

<p>Proverbs xxi. 13. The virtuous woman, so admirably described
in this chapter, “seeketh wool and flax, and worketh
willingly with her hands.” (See Part First, Chapter I. <a href="#Page_13">p. 13.</a>).
This proves, that flax was still an important article of cultivation
in Palestine.</p>

<p>In 1 Chron. iv. 21. there is an allusion to a great establishment
for dressing the fine flax, called <i>Butz</i>, or <i>Byssus</i>. It
was conducted by certain families of the tribe of Judah<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>.</p>

for those who were to be engaged in sacred services, on
account of its superior cleanliness and purity. They were not
to “<i>gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat</i>.” On
returning to the outer court, so as to be in contact with the
people, they were to put on the common dress, which was at
least in part woollen.</p>

<p>In Rev. xv. 6. the seven angels come out of the temple
clothed “<i>in pure and white linen</i>.” This is to be explained
by what has been already said of the use of linen for the temple
service among the Egyptians and the Jews. On three other
occasions mentioned in the New Testament, <i>viz.</i> the case of
the young man, who had “a linen cloth cast about his naked
body” (<i>Mark</i> xiv. 51, 52.); the entombment of Christ (<i>Matt.</i>
xxvii. 59. <i>Mark</i> xv. 46. <i>Luke</i> xxiii. 53. xxiv. 12. <i>John</i>
xix. 40. xx. 5, 6, 7.); and the case of the “sheet” let down in
vision from heaven (<i>Acts</i> x. 11. xi. 5.), the sacred writers employ
the equivalent Egyptian terms, Σινδών, and Ὀθόνη or Ὀθόνιον.</p>

<p>The “Byssus of the Hebrews,” mentioned by Pausanias may
have been so called, because it was imported into Greece by the
Hebrews, not because it grew in Palestine, as many critics have
concluded.</p>

<p>Herodotus (<i>l. c.</i>) observes, that the Greeks called the Colchian
flax Σαρδονικόν. The epithet must be understood as referring to
Sardes, from the vicinity of which city flax was obtained according
to the testimony of Julius Pollux (<i>l. c.</i>). In another
passage Herodotus remarks (v. 87.), that the linen shift worn
by the Athenian women, was originally Carian. The Milesian
Sindones, mentioned by Jonathan, the Chaldee Paraphrast, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
Lam. ii. 20, were, no doubt, made of the flax of this country,
although Forster (<i>De Bysso</i>, <i>p.</i> 92.), on account of the celebrity
of the Milesian wool, supposes them to have been woollen. It
is probable, that the Milesian net caps, worn by ladies, were
made of linen thread.</p>

<p>Jerome, describing the change from an austere to a luxurious
mode of life, mentions shirts from <i>Laodicea</i>. Some commentators
have supposed linen shirts to be meant.</p>

<p>According to Julius Pollux (vii. <i>c.</i> 16.) the Athenians and
Ionians wore a linen shirt reaching to the feet. But the use of
it among the Athenians must have come in much later than
among the Ionians, who would adopt the practice in consequence
of the cultivation of flax in their own country as well
as in their colonies on the Euxine Sea, and also in consequence
of the general elegance and refinement of their manners.
Indeed it appears probable, that the linen used by the Athenians
was imported.</p>

<p>The only part of Greece, where flax is recorded to have been
grown, was Elis. That it was produced in that country is
affirmed by Pliny (<i>l.</i> xix. <i>c.</i> 4.), and by Pausanias in three passages
already quoted.</p>

<p>When Colonel Leake was at Gastūni near the mouth of the
Peneus in Elis, he made the following observations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For flax (one of the chief things produced there) the land is once ploughed in
the spring, and two or three times in the ensuing autumn, with a pair of oxen,
when the seed is thrown in and covered with the plough. The plant does not
require and hardly admits of weeding, as it grows very thick. When ripe, it is
pulled up by the roots, and laid in bundles in the sun. It is then threshed to separate
the seed. The bundles are laid in the river for five days, then dried in the
sun, and pressed in a wooden machine. Contrary to its ancient reputation, the
flax of Gastuni is not very fine. It is chiefly used in the neighboring islands by
the peasants, who weave it into cloths for their own use<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>.</p>

<p>In one of the Pseudo-Platonic Epistles (No. xiii. <i>p.</i> 363.)
mention occurs of linen shifts for ladies, made in Sicily, which
certainly implies nothing more than that linen was woven in
Sicily. The material for making it may have been imported.
In like manner the linen of Malta was exceedingly admired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
for its fineness and softness<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>; but the raw material was in all
probability imported.</p>

<p>“Flax,” observes Professor Müller, “was grown and manufactured
in Southern Etruria from ancient times, and thus the
Tarquinii were enabled to furnish <i>sail-cloth for the fleet of
Scipio</i>: yarn for making nets was produced on the banks of
the Tiber, and fine linen for clothing in Falerii<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>.” This account
agrees remarkably with the views of Micali, and those
historians who maintain the Egyptian origin of the Etrurians.</p>

<p>Pliny (xix. 1, 2.) mentions various kinds of flax of superior
excellence, which were produced in the plains of the Po and
Ticino; in the country of the Peligni (in Picenum); and about
Cumæ in Campania<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>. No flax, he says, was whiter or more
like wool than that of the Peligni.</p>

<p>In the next chapter Pliny gives an account of the mode of
preparing flax; plucking it up by the roots, tying it into bundles,
drying it in the sun, steeping, drying again, beating it with
a mallet on a stone, and lastly hackling it, or, as he says,
“<i>combing it with iron hooks</i>.” This may be compared with
the preceding extract from Colonel Leake’s Journal, and with
chapter 97 of Bartholomæus Anglicus, De Proprietabus Rerum,
which is perhaps partly copied from Pliny and treats of the
manufacture of flax, steeping it in water, &amp;c., and of its use
for clothes, nets, sails, thread, and curtains.</p>

<p>In Spain there was a manufacture of linen at Emporium,
which lay on the Mediterranean not far from the Pyrenees<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>.
According to Pliny (<i>l. c.</i>) remarkably beautiful flax was produced
in Hispania Citerior near Tarraco. He ascribes its splendor
to the virtues of the river-water flowing near Tarraco, in which
the flax was steeped and prepared. Still further southward on
the same coast we find Setabis, the modern Xativa, which is
celebrated by various authors for the beauty of its linen, and
especially for linen <i>sudaria</i>, or handkerchiefs:</p>

<p>Strabo (iv. 2. 2. p. 41. ed. Sieb.) particularly mentions the
linen manufacture of the Cadurci: and from them the Romans

<p>Flax, as we are told by Pliny (xix. 1.), was <i>woven into sail-cloth
in all parts of Gaul</i>; and, in some of the countries beyond
the Rhine, the most beautiful apparel of the ladies was
linen. Tacitus states that the women of Germany wore linen

<p>The following translation of a passage from Eginhart’s Life
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>

centuries the Franks wore linen for their under garments.</p>

the Sagum was the principal article of dress manufactured in

<p>According to Paulus Diaconus, as quoted in the notes on this

<p>Linen, which appears to have been originally characteristic
of the Egyptian and Germanic nations, came by degrees into
more and more general use among the Greeks and Romans,
and was employed not only for articles of dress, especially those
worn by women, and for sheets to lie upon, but also for <i>table-covers</i>
and for <i>napkins</i> to wipe the hands, an application of
them which was the more necessary on account of the want of
knives, forks, and spoons. Also those who waited at table,
were girt with towels. At the baths persons used towels to dry
themselves. A man wore a similar piece of cloth under the
hands of the tonsor. Plutarch (<i>On Garrulity</i>) tells the following
anecdote of Archelaus. When a loquacious hair-dresser
was throwing the ὠμόλινον about him in order to shear him, he
asked as usual, “How shall I cut your majesty’s hair?” “<i>In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
silence</i>,” replied the king. Alciphron tells of the barber putting
on him a linen cloth (σινδών) in order to shave him (<i>l.</i> iii. Ep.
66.); and Phaneas, in an Epigram, calls the cloth used in
shaving by the same name, Σινδών. Diogenes Laertius also (vi.
90.) tells a story respecting the philosopher Crates, which shows
that at Athens it was not deemed proper for a man to wear
linen as an outer garment, but that persons were enveloped in
it under the hands of the hair-dresser. “The Athenian police-officers
(οἱ ἀστύνομοι) having charged him with wearing a linen sheet
for his outer garment, he said, ‘I will show you Theophrastus
himself habited in that manner;’ and when they doubted the
fact, he took them to see Theophrastus at the hair-dresser’s.”</p>

<p>Coarser linen was used in great quantity both for sails, and
for awnings to keep off the heat of the sun from the Roman
theatres, the Forum, and other places of public resort<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>.</p>

<p>The Emperor Alexander Severus, as we learn from the following
passage of his Life written by Ælius Lampridius, was a
great admirer of good linen, and preferred that which was plain
to such as had <i>flowers</i> or <i>feathers</i> interwoven as practised in
Egypt and the neighboring countries.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Boni linteaminis appetitor fuit, et quidem puri, dicens, ‘Si lintei idcirco sunt,
ut nihil asperum habeant, quid opus est purpurâ?’ In lineâ autem aurum mitti,

<p>He took great delight in good linen, and preferred it plain. “If,” said he, “linen
cloths are made of that material in order that they may not be at all rough,
<i>why mix purple with them</i>?” But to <i>interweave gold in linen</i>, he considered
madness, because this made it rigid in addition to its roughness.</p>

<p>The following passage of the Life of the Emperor Carinus
by Flavius Vopiscus is remarkable as proving the value attached
by the Romans of that age to the linen imported from
Egypt and Phœnice, especially to the <i>transparent</i> and <i>flowered</i>
varieties.</p>

OF HEMP.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_542" href="#FNanchor_542" class="label">[542]</a> According to a statement in the Western (Missouri) Journal, about 7,000
bales of hemp, the crop of 1844, was shipped from that place last spring. It is
thought that 20,000 bales will be raised in that neighborhood this year (1845).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The use of Hemp among the ancients was very limited. It
is never mentioned in the Scriptures, and not often by the
heathen writers of antiquity. It is remarkable, that no notice
is taken of it by Theophrastus. It was however used among
the Greeks and Romans, for making ropes and nets, but not for
sacks, these being made of goats’-hair<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>.</p>

<p>The only reason for introducing hemp in this enumeration
is, that, according to Herodotus (iv. 74.) <i>garments were made
of it by the Thracians</i>. “They were so like linen,” says he,
“that none but a very experienced person could tell whether they
were of hemp or flax; one, who had never seen hemp, would
certainly suppose them to be linen.” The coarser kinds of
linen would, it is certain, be scarcely, if at all distinguishable
from the finer kinds of hempen cloth.</p>

<p>Hesychius (<i>v.</i> Κάνναβις) quotes the preceding remark of Herodotus,
only saying that the Thracian <i>women</i> made <i>sheets</i> of
hemp (ἱμάτια). In substituting these expressions he puts upon
the words of Herodotus an explanation derived from his familiar
knowledge of Grecian customs. To the present day hemp
is produced abundantly in the vicinity of the countries which
were occupied by the ancient Thracians. A traveller who has
lately visited them, informs us, that “the men who drive the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
horses, which drag the boats upon the Danube between Pest
and Vienna, <i>now wear coarse tunics of hemp</i><a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>.</p>

<p>The next writer, who mentions hemp after Herodotus, is
Moschion, rather more than 200 years B. C. He states<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>, that
the magnificent ship Syracusia, built by the command of Hiero
II., was provided with hemp from the Rhone for making ropes.
The common materials for such purposes were <i>the Egyptian
Papyrus, the bark of the Lime-tree, of the Hemp-leaved
Mallow, and of the Spanish and Portugal Broom</i>, and
probably also the Stipa Tenacissima of Linnæus.</p>

<p>Hemp, as well as flax, was grown abundantly in Colchis<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>.
It was brought to the ports of the Ægean Sea by the Ionian
merchants, who were intimately connected with the northern
and eastern coasts of the Euxine through the medium of the
Milesian colonies. This fact may account for the cultivation of
hemp in Caria. The best was obtained in the time of Pliny
(<i>l.</i> xix. <i>c.</i> 9.) from Alabanda and Mylasa in that country. Pliny
also mentions a kind, which grew in the country of the Sabines,
and which was remarkable for its height.</p>

<p>On the whole we may conclude, that hemp was not the
natural growth either of Italy, Greece, or Asia Minor, but was
confined, as it still is in a great degree, to countries lying further
north and having a more rigid climate. The intimate connexion
of the Romans with the Greek colony of Marseilles
may have brought it among the Sabines, as the active trade
between the Euxine and Miletus may have introduced it into
Caria. With the material its name was also imported, and this
is substantially the same in all the languages of Europe, as
well as in many Asiatic tongues<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>.</p>

<p>Hemp is comparatively rare in India, as well as flax; and, as flax is there
only used for obtaining oil, so hemp is never used for making cordage or for
weaving, <i>but only for smoking on account of the narcotic qualities of its leaves</i>.
(Wissett on Hemp, p. 20, 25.) Its name <span class="smcap">Sana</span>, <span class="smcap">Sunu</span>, or <span class="smcap">Gonu</span>, is given also to
the Crotalaria Juncea, which is principally applied by the Indians to the same
uses as hemp in Europe. See Chap. XIII. <a href="#Page_202">p. 202.</a></p>

<p>If we compare flax with other spinning materials, such as wool and cotton, we
shall find it to possess several characteristic properties. While cotton and wool
are presented by nature in the form of insulated fibres, the former requiring merely
to be separated from its seeds, and the latter to be purified from dirt and grease
before being delivered to the spinner, flax must have its filaments separated from
each other by tedious and painful treatment. In reference to the spinning and
the subsequent operations, the following properties of flax are influential and important:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The considerable length of the fibres, which renders it difficult, on the one
hand, to form a fine, level, regular thread, on the other, gives the yarn a considerably
greater tenacity, so that it cannot be broken by pulling out the threads
from each other, but by tearing them across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
2. The smooth and slim structure of the filaments, which gives to linen its peculiar
polished aspect, and feel so different from cotton, and especially from woollen
stuffs, unless when disguised by dressing. The fibres of flax have no mutual
entanglement, whereby one can draw out another as with wool, and they must
therefore be made adhesive by moisture. This wetting of the fibres renders them
more pliant and easier to twist together</p>

<p>3. The small degree of elasticity, by which the simple fibres can be stretched
only one twenty-fifth of their natural length before they break, while sheep’s wool
will stretch from one fourth to one half before it gives way.</p>

<p>Good flax should have a bright silver gray or yellowish color (inclining neither
to green nor black); it should be long, fine, soft, and glistening, somewhat like
silk, and contain no broad tape-like portions, from undissevered filaments. Tow
differs from flax in having shorter fibres, of very unequal length, and more or less
entangled. Hemp agrees in its properties essentially with flax, and must be similarly
treated in the spinning processes.</p>

<p>The manufacture of linen and hemp yarn, and the tow of either, may be effected
by different processes; by the distaff, the hand-wheel, and spinning machinery.
It will be unnecessary to occupy the pages of this volume with a description
of the first two well known domestic employments. Spinning of flax by
<i>machinery</i> has been much more recently brought to a practical state than the
spinning of cotton and wool by machines, of which the cause must be sought for
in the nature of flax as above described. The first attempts at the machine spinning
of flax, went upon the principle of cutting the filaments into short fragments
before beginning the operation. But in this way the most valuable property of
linen yarn, its cohesive force, was greatly impaired; or these attempts were restricted
to the spinning of tow, which on account of its short and somewhat tortuous
fibres, could be treated like cotton, especially after it had been further torn
by the carding engine. The first tolerably good results with machinery seem to
have been obtained by the brothers Girard at Paris, about the year 1810. But
the French have never carried the apparatus to any great practical perfection.
The towns of Leeds in Yorkshire, of Dundee in Scotland, and Belfast in Ireland,
have the merit of bringing the spinning of flax by machines into a state of perfection
little short of that for which the cotton trade has been so long celebrated.</p>

<p>For machine spinning, the flax is sometimes heckled by hand, and sometimes
by machinery. The series of operations is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The heckling.</p>

<p>2. The conversion of the flax into a band of parallel rectilinear filaments, which,
forms the foundation of the future yarn.</p>

<p>3. The formation of a sliver from the riband, by drawing it out into a narrower
range of filaments.</p>

<p>4. The coarse spinning, by twisting the sliver into a coarse and loose thread.</p>

<p>5. The fine spinning, by the simultaneous extension and twisting of that coarse
thread.</p>

<p>All heckle machines have this common property, that the flax is not drawn
through them, as in working by hand, but, on the contrary, the system of heckles
is moved through the flax properly suspended or laid. Differences exist in the
shape, arrangement, and movements of the heckles, as also in regard to the means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
by which the adhering tow is removed from them. The simplest and most common
construction is to place the heckles upon the surface of a horizontal cylinder,
while the flax is held either by mechanical means or by the hand during its exposure
to the heckle points. Many machines have been made upon this principle.
It is proper in this case to set the heckle teeth obliquely in the direction in which
the cylinder turns, whereby they penetrate the fibres in a more parallel line, effect
their separation more easily, and cause less waste in torn filaments. To conduct
the flax upon the cylinders, two horizontal fluted rollers of iron are employed,
which can be so modified in a moment by a lever as to present the flax more or
less to the heckling mechanism. The operator seizes a tress lock of flax with her
hand and introduces it between the fluted rollers, so that the tips on which the
operation must begin, reach the heckles first, and by degrees the advancing flax
gets heckled through two thirds or three fourths of its length, after which the tress
or strick is turned, and its other end is subjected to the same process. By its
somewhat rapid revolution the heckle cylinder creates a current of air which not
only carries away the boomy particles, but also spreads out the flax like a sheaf
of corn upon the spikes, effecting the same object as is done by the dexterous
swing of the hand. The tow collects betwixt the teeth of the heckle, and may,
when its quantity has become considerable, be removed in the form of a flock of
parallel layers.</p>

<p>Flax has been for a long period spun wet in the mills; a method no doubt copied
from the practice of housewives moistening their yarn with their saliva at
the domestic wheel. Within a few years the important improvement has been
introduced of substituting hot for cold water, in the troughs through which the
fibres in the act of spinning pass. By this means a much finer, smoother, and
more uniform thread can be spun than in the old way. The flax formerly spun
to twelve pounds a bundle is, with hot water, spun to six. The inconvenience of
the spray thrown from the yarn on the fliers remains, aggravated by increased
heat and dampness of the room where this hot process goes on. Being a new expedient,
it receives daily changes and ameliorations. When first employed, the
troughs of hot water were quite open; they are now usually covered in, so as almost
entirely to obviate the objections to which they were previously liable. With
the covers has been also introduced a new method of piecening or joining on any
end, which may have been run down, namely, by splicing it to the adjoining roving,
whereby it is carried through the water without imposing a necessity on the
spinner to put her hand into the water at all. In some places she uses a wire,
for the purpose of drawing through the end of the roving to mend a broken yarn.</p>

<p>This may be considered the inherent evil of flax-spinning,&mdash;the spray thrown
off by the wet yarn, as it whirls about with the flier of the spindles. A working
dress, indeed, is generally worn by the spinners; but, unless it be made of stuff
impermeable to water, like Mackintosh’s cloth, it will soon become uncomfortable,
and cause injury to health by keeping the body continually in a hot bath. In
some mills, water-proof cloth and leather aprons have actually been introduced,
which are the only practicable remedy; for the free space which must be left round
the spindles for the spinner to see them play, is incompatible with any kind of
fixed guard or <i>parapluie</i>.</p>

<p>Varro mentions the name <i>Asbestos</i> as a proof, that the cloth
so called was a Greek invention<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>. His argument is obviously

of this substance and were never consumed.</p>

<p>The fullest account of the properties and uses of Asbestos is
contained in the following passage from Sotacus, a Greek author
who wrote on Stones<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. The passage occurs in the Historiæ
Commentitiæ, attributed to Apollonius Dyscolus (<i>cap.</i> 36).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Carystian stone has woolly and colored appendages, which are <i>spun</i> and
woven into <i>napkins</i>. This substance is also twisted into wicks, which, when
burnt, are bright, but do not consume. The napkins, when dirty, are not washed
with water, but a fire is made of sticks, and then the napkin is put into it.
The dirt disappears, and the napkin is rendered white and pure by the fire, and
is applicable to the same purposes as before. The wicks remain burning with oil
continually without being consumed. This stone is produced in Carystus, from
which it has its name, and in great abundance in Cyprus under rocks to the left

was asbestos from the vicinity of Carpasus, a town near the
north-east corner of Cyprus, which retains its ancient name,
<i>Carpas</i>.</p>

<p>Referring to Cyprus, Sonnini (<i>Voyage en Grèce</i>, i. <i>p.</i> 66.)
says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>L’amiante, <i>asbestos</i>, ou lin incombustible des anciens, est encore aussi abondant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
qu’il le fut autrefois; la carrière qui le fournit est dans la montagne d’Akamantide,
près du cap Chromachiti.</p>

<p>Le talc est commun, surtout près de Larnaca, où on l’emploie à blanchir les
maisons; et le plàtre a de nombreuses carrières.</p>
</div>

<p>The “talc” may be the same with the “Lapis specularis,”
which was found in Cyprus, according to Pliny (xxxvi. 45.).
The testimony of Sonnini so far agrees with those of the
ancients, that all the places mentioned were on the northern
side of the island, so that the asbestos seems to have been
found between Solæ towards the West and Carpas towards the
East.</p>

<p>Pietro della Valle, when he was at Larnaca, was presented
with a piece of the amiantus of the country, but says that it
was no longer spun and woven.</p>

<p>Pliny, if we can rely upon his testimony as given in the existing
editions of his works, states, that Asbestos was obtained
in Arcadia (H. N. xxxvii. 54.) and in India.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A kind of flax has been discovered which is incombustible by fire. It is
called <i>live flax</i>; and we have seen napkins of it burning upon the hearth at entertainments,
and, when thus deprived of their dirt, more resplendent through the
agency of fire than they could have been by the use of water. The funeral shirts
made of it for kings preserve the ashes of the body separate from those of the rest
of the pile. It is produced in deserts and in tracts scorched by the Indian sun,
where there are no showers, and among dire serpents, and thus it is inured to live
even when it is burnt. It is rare, and woven with difficulty on account of the
shortness of its fibres. That variety which is of a red color becomes resplendent
in the fire. When it has been found it equals the prices of excellent pearls. It is
called by the Greeks Asbestine Flax, on account of its nature. Anaxilaus relates,
that if a tree surrounded with cloth made of it be beaten, the strokes are
not heard. On account of these properties this flax is the first in the world. The
next in value is that made of byssus, which is produced about Elis in Achaia,
and used principally for fine female ornaments. I find that a scruple of this flax,
as also of gold, was formerly sold for four denarii<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>. The nap of linen cloths, obtained
chiefly from the sails of ships, is of great use in surgery, and their ashes
have the same effect as spodium. There is a certain kind of poppy the use of
which imparts the highest degree of whiteness to linen cloths.”&mdash;Pliny, Lib. xix.
ch. 4.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a id="Footnote_560" href="#FNanchor_560" class="label">[560]</a> i. e. eighteen grains of this flax were worth 2<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> stg., being equal in value

<p>Besides the manufacture of napkins, this description exactly
agrees with the accounts of Strabo, Sotacus, Dioscorides, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
Plutarch. Pliny’s account of the use of this material in funerals
has been remarkably confirmed by the occasional discovery
of pieces of asbestine cloth in the tombs of Italy. One was
found in 1633 at Puzzuolo, and was preserved in the Barberini
gallery<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>. Another was found in 1702 a mile without the gate
called Porta Major in Rome. We have an account of the discovery
in a letter written from Rome at the time; and appended
to Montfaucon’s Travels through Italy. A marble sarcophagus
having been discovered in a vineyard was found to contain the
cloth, which was about 5 feet wide, and 6½ long. It contained
a skull and the other burnt bones of a human body. The
sculptured marble indicates, that the deceased was a man of rank.
He is supposed to have lived not earlier than the time of Constantine.
This curious relic of antiquity has been preserved in
the Vatican Library since the period of its discovery, and Sir
J. E. Smith, who saw it there, gives the following description
of its appearance:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Brachmans use cloth made of a kind of flax, which is obtained from
rocks. <i>Webs</i> are produced from it, which are neither subject to be consumed by
fire nor cleansed by water, but which, after they have become full of dirt and
stains, are rendered clear and white by being thrown into the fire.</p>

to separate the earthy particles; spun and woven into cloth;
and cleansed, when dirty, by being thrown into the fire.</p>

<p>Bugnon, in his <i>Rélation Exacte concernant les Caravanes</i>
(<i>Nancy</i>, 1707, <i>p.</i> 37-39.) mentions, that Amiantus was found
in Cyprus and on the confines of Arabia. He says, <i>they spun
it and made stockings, socks, and drawers</i>, which fitted closely;
that over these they wore their other garments; and that
they were thus protected from the heat in travelling with the
caravans through Asia.</p>

<p>Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea, shows that he was acquainted with
the properties of this substance, <i>by comparing the three children
cast into the fiery furnace without being hurt</i> (<i>Dan.</i> iii.)
to Asbestos, “which, when put into the fire seems to burn and
to be turned to ashes, but, when taken out, becomes purer and
brighter than it was before<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.”</p>

<p>Damasus (<i>in Silvestro Papa</i>) mentions, that the Emperor
Constantine directed asbestos to be used for the wicks of the

<p>For further particulars respecting the places where amiantus
is procured, and the mode of preparing it for the manufacture
of cloth, we refer to the treatises of mineralogists and to the
Essays of Ciampini, Tilingius, Mahudel, and Bruckmann on
this particular subject. We are informed, that it is softened and
rendered supple by being steeped in oil, and that <i>fibres of flax
are then mixed with it</i> in order that it may be spun. When
the cloth is woven, it is put into the fire, by which the flax and
oil are dissipated, and the asbestos alone remains<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>.</p>

and there rubbed and turned about. An earth separates from it, which makes
the water as white as milk. This is repeated five or six times. The fibres, thus
purified, are spread out to dry.</p>

<p>Ignorance of the true nature of Asbestos caused it to be employed
in the dark ages for purposes of superstition and religious
fraud. Of this we have a proof in the following account
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
which we find in the Chronicon Casinense of Leo Ostiensis,

<p>There is no good reason to doubt the truth of this narrative
so far as respects the veracity and credit of the historian. Leo
Ostiensis became an inmate of the Abbey of Monte Casino a
few years after the event is said to have happened, and could
scarcely be misinformed respecting the circumstances, more especially
as he held during the latter part of his abode there the
office of Librarian. There is nothing improbable in the story.
Asbestine cloth, as we have learnt from Marco Polo, was manufactured
in Asia during the middle ages, and the reputed relic
was obtained at Jerusalem. That the pilgrims, who visited
Jerusalem, should be imposed upon in this manner, is in the
highest degree probable, since we are informed, that the very
same substance <i>in its natural state</i> was often sold to devotees
AS THE WOOD OF THE TRUE CROSS, and its incombustibility
was exhibited as the proof of its genuineness.
This we learn in the following passage from Tilingius, who
wrote “<i>De lino vivo aut asbestino et incombustibili</i>.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

The monks on their arrival at Monte Casino would naturally
display the same evidence, by which they themselves had
been convinced; and the appearance of the cloth, when put
into the fire and taken out of it, is described exactly as it
would be in fact, supposing it to have been made of amiantus.</p>

<p>Montfaucon, in his Travels in Italy (<i>p.</i> 381. <i>English ed.</i>
8<i>vo.</i>), describes a splendid service book, which was written A. D.
1072 by Leo at the expense of brother John of Marsicana, and
presented by John to the Monastery of Monte Casino, where it
was exhibited to Montfaucon as one of the most valuable and
curious monuments. An illumination in this book represents a
monk <i>kneeling before St. Benedict</i>, the patron and founder
of the institution, and holding in his hands a cloth, on which
St. Benedict is placing his left foot. Montfaucon gives an engraving
from this picture: he supposes the cloth to be a monk’s
cowl, and conjectures that it was thus used in admitting novices.
This explanation is evidently a most unsatisfactory one, nothing
being produced to render it even probable. We believe the
cloth to be that the history of which has just now been given, and
that the design of the artist was to represent a monk <i>wiping
the feet of St. Benedict with the same cloth with which Jesus
wiped the feet of his disciples</i>.</p>

<p>This supposition will appear the more probable if we attend
to the date of the MS. (A. D. 1072) and the persons, by whom
and at whose expense it was written. “<i>Brother</i> John of Marsicana”
appears to have been at this time advanced in years,
wealthy, and highly respected, since we are informed, that in
the year 1055, when Peter was chosen Abbot of the Monastery,
some of the brotherhood wished to choose John, although
he, foreseeing that the choice would be likely to fall on him, had
obstinately sworn on the altar, that he would never undertake
the office. John was at this time provost of Capua<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>. Seventeen
years afterwards he went to the expense of providing the
service-book seen by Montfaucon. He employed as his scribe
one of the fraternity, who was his junior and from the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
city with himself. For there can be scarcely a doubt, but that
Leo, who wrote the MS., was the same who was the author of
the Chronicon. The author of the Chronicon, at the commencement
of his history, calls himself “Frater Leo, cognomine
Marsicanus<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>”. He was made Bishop of Ostia A. D. 1101,
so that we may suppose him to have been twenty or thirty
years of age, when the MS. was made. Of his aptitude for
such an employment we cannot doubt, when we consider his
future labors as Librarian and author of the Chronicle. But
if these facts be evident, it is equally manifest, that these two
accomplished Benedictines could not have expressed their veneration
towards their founder in any way better suited to their
ideas and belief than by exhibiting in the manner described
that relic, WHICH WAS SOLEMNLY DISPLAYED
ONCE A YEAR WITH BURNING CANDLES AND
ATTENDING ACOLYTHES TO THE ADMIRING
AND ADORING CROWD OF DEVOTEES.</p>

<p>A large glove of this substance is in the Hunterian Museum

<p>In modern times cloth of asbestos is scarcely made. Indeed
it is not probable that this material will ever be obtained in
much abundance, or that it will cease to be a rarity except in
the places of its production. It is never seen in Great Britain,

The annexed Map (<a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>) is designed to indicate the
divisions of the Ancient World as determined by the Raw
Materials principally produced and employed in them for
weaving.</p>

<p>The Red division produced Sheeps’-Wool and Goats’-Hair:
also Beavers’-Wool in the portion of this division, which lies to
the North of the Mediterranean Sea, and of the rivers Padus
and Ister: and Camels’-Wool and Camels’-Hair in the portion
lying South-East of a line drawn through the coast of Syria.
The nations to the North of this division clothed themselves in
skins, furs, and felt.</p>

<p>The Yellow at the Eastern corner indicates the commencement
of the vast Region, unknown to the Ancients, the
inhabitants of which clothed themselves in Silk.</p>

<p>The Green indicates the countries, all low and bordering on
rivers, in which the cloth manufactured was chiefly Linen.</p>

<p>The Brown is designed to show the cultivation of Hemp in
the low country to the North of the Euxine Sea, and probably
in other places, North of the Red division, which were adapted
for its growth.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Blue, which is the colour of the Baharein Isles
and of India, shows that the inhabitants of these countries
have from time immemorial clothed themselves in Cotton.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_569" href="#FNanchor_569" class="label">[569]</a> The edition here followed is that of Sillig, Lipsiæ, 1831-6, 5 vols., 12mo.</p>

<p>“We are also much indebted to sheep both in sacrifices to propitiate the gods,
and in the use of their fleeces. As oxen produce by cultivation the food of men,
so we owe to sheep the protection of our bodies.... There are two principal
kinds of sheep, the <i>covered</i> and the <i>common</i>. The former is softer, the latter
more delicate in feeding, inasmuch as the covered feeds on brambles. Its
coverings are chiefly of Arabic materials.</p>

<p>“The most approved wool is the Apulian, and that which is called <i>the wool
of Greek sheep</i> in Italy, and <i>the Italic wool</i> in other places. The third kind in
value is that obtained from Milesian sheep. The Apulian wools have a short
staple, and are only celebrated for making pænulas. They attain the highest
degree of excellence about Tarentum and Canusium. In Asia wools of the same
kind are obtained at Laodicea. No white wool is preferred to those which are
produced about the Po, nor has a pound ever yet exceeded a hundred sesterces
(about $3,60.). Sheep are not shorn everywhere: in certain places the practice
of pulling off the wool continues. There are various colors of wool, so that we
want terms to denote all. Spain produces some of those varieties which we call
<i>native</i>; Pollentia, near the Alps, furnishes the chief kinds of black wool; Asia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
and Bætica those ruddy varieties called <i>Erythrean</i>; Canusium a sandy-colored<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
wool; and Tarentum one of a dark shade peculiar to that locality. New-shorn
greasy wools have all a medicinal virtue. The wool of Istria and Liburnia being
more like hair than wool, is unsuitable for making the cloths which have a <i>long</i>
nap. This is also the case with the wool of Salacia in Lusitania; but the cloth
made from it is recommended by its <i>plaided pattern</i>. A similar kind is produced
about Piscenæ (i. e. <i>Pezenas</i>), in the province of Narbonne, and likewise
in Egypt, the woollen cloth of which country, having been worn by use, is <i>embroidered</i>
and lasts some time longer. The <i>coarse wool with a thick staple was
used in very ancient times for carpets</i>: at least Homer (900 B. C.) speaks of
the use of it. <i>The Gauls have one method of embroidering these carpets, and
the Parthians another.</i> Portions of wool also make cloth <i>by being forced together
by themselves</i><a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>. With the addition of vinegar these also resist iron, nay
even fires, which are the last expedient for purging them; for, having been taken
out of the caldrons of the polishers, they are sold for the stuffing of beds, an invention
made, I believe, in Gaul, certainly in the present day distinguished by
Gallic names: for in what age it commenced I could not easily say, since the
ancients used beds of straw, such as are now employed in camps. The cloths
called <i>gausapa</i> began to be used within the memory of my father; those called
<i>amphimalla</i> within my own, (See Part First, <a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a>,) as well as the shaggy coverings
for the stomach, called <i>ventralia</i>. For the tunic with the laticlave is now
first beginning to be woven after the manner of the <i>gausapa</i>. The black wools
are never dyed. Concerning the dyeing of the others we shall speak in their
proper places, in treating of sea-shells or the nature of herbs.</p>

<p>“M. Varro says, that the wool continued to his time upon the distaff and spindle
of Tanaquil, also called Caia Cæcilia, in the temple of Sangus; and that there remained
in the temple of Fortune a royal undulate toga made by her, which Servius
Tullius had worn. Hence arose the practice of carrying a distaff with wool upon
it, and a spindle with its thread, after virgins who were going to be married. She
first wove the straight tunic, such as is worn by tiros together with the <i>toga
pura</i>, and by newly-married women. The <i>undulate</i> or waved cloth was originally
one of the most admired; from it was derived the <i>soriculate</i><a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>. Fenestrella
writes, that <i>scraped</i> and <i>Phryxian</i> togas came into favor about the end of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
reign of the Divine Augustus. The <i>thick poppied</i> togas are of remoter origin, being
noticed even so far back as by the poet Lucilius in his Torquatus. The <i>toga
prætexta</i> was invented among the Etruscans. I find evidence that kings wore
the <i>striped toga</i><a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>, that figured cloths were in use even in the days of Homer;
and that these gave rise to the <i>triumphal</i>. To produce this effect with the needle
was the invention of the Phrygians, on which account cloths so embroidered
have been called <i>Phrygionic</i>. In the same part of Asia king Attalus (see Part
I. <a href="#Page_88">p. 88.</a>) discovered the art of inserting a woof of gold: from which circumstance
the <i>Attalic</i> cloths received their name. Babylon first obtained celebrity by its
method of <i>diversifying the picture with different colors</i>, and gave its name to
textures of this description. But to weave with a great number of leashes, so as to
produce the cloths called <i>polymita</i> (i. e. damask cloths), was first taught in Alexandria;
to divide by squares (i. e. plaids) in Gaul. Metellus Scipio brought it as
an accusation against Cato, that even in his time Babylonian coverlets for triclinia
were sold for 800,000 sesterces ($30,000), although the emperor Nero lately
gave for them no less than 4,000,000 sesterces (about $150,000). The <i>prætexta</i>
of Servius Tullius, covering the statue of Fortune which he dedicated, remained
until the death of Sejanus, and it is wonderful that they had neither decayed of
themselves nor been injured by the worms of moths through the space of 560
years. We have, moreover, seen the fleeces of living sheep dyed with purple,
with the coccus, or the murex, in pieces of bark <i>a foot and a half long</i>, luxury
appearing to force this upon them as if it were their nature.</p>

<p>“In the sheep itself the excellence of the breed is sufficiently shown by the
shortness of the legs and the clothing of the belly. Those which have naked
bellies used to be called <i>apicæ</i>, and were condemned. The tails of the Syrian
sheep are a cubit broad, and in that part they bear a great quantity of wool. It
is thought premature to castrate lambs before they are five months old. In Spain,
but especially in Corsica, there is a race of animals called musmons, resembling
sheep, except that their covering is more like goats’-hair. The ancients called
the mixed breed of sheep and musmons <i>Umbri</i>. <i>Sheep have a very weak head</i>,
on which account they are obliged to turn from the sun in feeding. <i>They are
most foolish animals.</i> Where they have been afraid to enter, they follow one
dragged along by the horn. They live ten years at the longest, but in Æthiopia
thirteen years. Goats live there eleven years, and in other countries eight at the
most.... In Cilicia and about the Syrtes, goats have a shaggy
coat, which admits of being shorn.”</p>

<p>The date was carried considerably higher by Schwandner,
Principal Keeper of the Imperial Library at Vienna, who found
among the charters of the Monastery of Göss in Upper Stiria
one in a state of decay, only seven inches long and three wide.
So highly did he estimate the value of this curious relic as to
publish in 1788 a full account of his discovery in a thin quarto
volume, which bears the following title, “<i>Chartam linteam
antiquissimam, omnia hactenus producta specimina ætate
suâ superantem, ex cimelüs Bibliothecæ Augustæ Vindobonensis
exponit Jo. Ge. Schwandner</i>,” &amp;c. The document is a
mandate of Frederick II. Emperor of the Romans, entrusting
to the Archbishop of Saltzburg and the Duke of Austria the
determination of a dispute between the Duke of Carinthia and
the Monastery of Göss respecting the property of the latter in
Carinthia. Schwandner proves the date of it to be 1243. He
does not say whether it has any lines or water-mark, but is quite
satisfied from its flexibility and other qualities, that it is linen.
Although on the first discovery of this document some doubt
was expressed as to its genuineness, it appears to have risen in
estimation with succeeding writers; and we apprehend it is
rather from inadvertence than from any deficiency in the evidence,
that it is not noticed at all by Schönemann, Ebert,
Delandine, or by Horne. Due attention is, however, bestowed
upon it by August Friedrich Pfeiffer <i>Uber Bücher-Handschriften,
Erlangen</i> 1810, <i>p.</i> 39, 40.</p>

<p>With regard to the circumstances which led to the invention
of the paper <i>now in common use</i>, or the country in which it
took place, we find in the writers on the subject from Polydore
Virgil to the present day nothing but conjectures or confessions
of ignorance. Wehrs supposes, and others follow him, that in
making paper linen rags were either by accident or through
design at first mixed with cotton rags, so as to produce a paper,
which was partly linen and partly cotton, and that this led by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
degrees to the manufacture of paper from linen only<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>. Wehrs
also endeavors to claim the honor of the invention for Germany,
his own country; but Schönemann gives that distinction to
Italy, because there, in the district of Ancona, a considerable
manufacture of cotton paper was carried on before the fourteenth
century<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>. All however admit, that they have no satisfactory
evidence on the subject.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A clear light is thrown upon these questions by a remark of
the Arabian physician, Abdollatiph, who visited Egypt A. D.
1200. He informs us<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>, “<i>that the cloth found in the catacombs,
and used to envelope the mummies, was made into garments,
or sold to the scribes to make paper for shop-keepers</i>.”
Having shown (See Part IV. <a href="#Chapter4_I">Chapter I.</a>) that this cloth was
linen, the passage of Abdollatiph, therefore, may be considered
as a decisive proof, which, however, has never been produced
as such, of the manufacture of linen paper as early as the
year 1200.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_578" href="#FNanchor_578" class="label">[578]</a> Chapter iv. p. 188 of Silvestre de Sacy’s French translation, p. 221 of Wahl’s
German translation. This interesting passage was translated as follows by Edward
Pococke, the younger:&mdash;“Et qui ex Arabibus, incolisve Rifæ, aliisve, has
arcas indagant, hæc integumenta diripiunt, quodque in iis rapiendum invenitur;
et conficiunt sibi vestes, aut ea chartarüs vendunt ad conficiendam chartam emporeaticam.”</p>

<p>Silvestre de Sacy (Notice, &amp;c.), animadverting on White’s version which is
entirely different, expresses his approbation of Pococke’s, from which Wahl’s does
not materially differ.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This account coincides remarkably with what we know from
various other sources. Professor Tychsen, in his learned and
curious dissertation on the use of paper from Papyrus (published
in the <i>Commentationes Reg. Soc. Gottingensis Recentiores</i>,
vol. iv. A. D. 1820), has brought abundant testimonies to
prove <i>that Egypt supplied all Europe with this kind of
paper until towards the end of the eleventh century</i>. The
use of it was then abandoned, cotton paper being employed instead.
The Arabs in consequence of their conquests in
Bucharia had learnt the art of making <i>cotton paper</i> about the
year 704, and through them or the Saracens it was introduced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
into Europe in the eleventh century<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. We may therefore consider
it as in the highest degree probable, that the mode of
making cotton paper was known to the paper-makers of Egypt.
At the same time endless quantities of linen cloth, the best of
all materials for the manufacture of paper, were to be obtained
from the catacombs.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>
</div>

<p>If we put together these circumstances, we cannot but perceive
how they conspire to illustrate and justify the statement
of Abdollatiph. We perceive the interest which the great
Egyptian paper-manufacturers had in the improvement of their
article, and the unrivalled facilities which they possessed for
this purpose; and thus, we apprehend, the direct testimony of
an eye-witness of the highest reputation for veracity and intelligence,
supported as it is by collateral probabilities, clears up in
a great measure the long-agitated question respecting the origin
of paper such as we <i>now</i> commonly use for writing.</p>

<p>The evidence being carried thus far, we may take in connection
with it the following passage from Petrus Cluniacensis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Latin 444]Sed cojusmodi librum? Si talem quales quotidie in usu legendi habemus, utique
ex pellibus arietum, hircorum, vel vitulorum, sive ex biblis, vel juncis orientalium
paludum, aut ex rasuris veterum pannorum, seu ex qualibet alia forte viliore
materia compactos, et pennis avium vel calamis palustrium locorum, qualibet
tinctura infectis descriptos.&mdash;<i>Tractatus adv. Judæos</i>, c. v. <i>in Max. Bibl. vet.
Patrum, tom.</i> xxii. p. 1014.</p>
</div>

<p>All the writers upon this subject, except Trombelli, suppose
the Abbot of Clugny to allude in the phrase “ex rasuris veterum
pannorum” to the use of woollen and cotton cloth only,
and not of linen. But, as we are now authorized to carry up
the invention of linen paper higher than before, and as the
mention of it by Abdollatiph justifies the conclusion that it was
manufactured in Egypt some time before his visit to that country
in 1200, we may reasonably conjecture that Petrus Cluniacensis
alluded to the same fact. The treatise above quoted is
supposed to have been written A. D. 1120. The account of
the materials used for making books appears to be full and accurate.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
The expression “<i>scrapings of old cloths</i>” agrees exactly
with the mode of making paper from linen rags, but is
not in accordance with any facts known to us respecting the
use of woollen or cotton cloth. The only objection against this
view of the subject is, that, as Peter of Clugny had not when
he wrote this passage travelled eastward of France, we can
scarcely suppose him to have been sufficiently acquainted with
the manners and productions of Egypt to introduce any allusion
to their newly invented mode of making paper. But we
know that the Abbey of Clugny had more than 300 churches,
colleges, and monasteries dependent on it, and that at least two
of these were in Palestine and one at Constantinople. The
intercourse which must have subsisted in this way between the
Abbey of Clugny and the Levant, may account for the Abbot
Peter’s acquaintance with the fact. It is therefore probable that
he alludes to the manufacture of paper in Egypt from the
cloth of mummies, which on this supposition had been invented
early in the twelfth century<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_580" href="#FNanchor_580" class="label">[580]</a> Gibbon says (vol. v. p. 295, 4to edition), “The inestimable art of transforming
linen into paper has been diffused from the manufacture of <i>Samarcand</i> over
the Western world.” This assertion appears to be entirely destitute of foundation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Another fact, which not only coincides with all the evidence
now produced, but carries the date of the invention still a little
higher, is the description of the manuscript No. 787, containing
an Arabic version of the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, in
Casiri’s <i>Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis</i>, tom. i.
p. 235. This MS. was probably brought from Egypt, or the
East. It has a date corresponding to A. D. 1100, and is of
linen paper according to Casiri, who calls it “Chartaceus.”</p>

<p>“Codices chartacei,” <i>i. e.</i> MSS. on linen paper, as old as the
thirteenth century, are mentioned not unfrequently in the Catalogues
of the Escurial, the Nani, and other libraries. Joseph
Brooks Yates, Esq. F. S. A., of West Dingle near Liverpool, is
in possession of a fine MS. of some of the Homilies of Chrysostom,
written in all probability not later than the thirteenth
century. It is on linen paper, with the water-lines perfectly distinct
in both directions. The water-mark is a tower, the size and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
form of which are shown in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> Fig. 18. From the appearance
of this paper, it is probable that the form or mould
may perhaps have been made of thin rods of cane or some
other vegetable. These rods, however, may have been metallic.
They were placed so close, that of the water-lines produced
by them 17 may be counted in the space of an inch, the
water-lines at right angles to these being one inch and a quarter
apart.</p>

<p>The preceding facts coincide with the opinion long ago expressed
by Prideaux, who concluded that linen paper was an
Eastern invention, because “most of the old MSS. in Arabic
and other oriental languages are written on this sort of paper,”
and that it was first introduced into Europe by the Saracens of
Spain<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A few observations, by way of concluding this part of the
subject, may here be properly bestowed upon the <i>material</i> with
which the <span class="allsmcap">WASP-FAMILY</span> construct their nests.</p>

<p>The wasp is <i>a paper-maker</i>, and a most perfect and intelligent
one. While mankind were arriving, by slow degrees, at
the art of fabricating this valuable substance, the wasp was
making it before their eyes, by very much the same process as
that by which human hands now manufacture it with the
best aid of chemistry and machinery. While some nations
carved their records on wood, and stone, and brass, and leaden
tablets,&mdash;others, more advanced, wrote with a style on wax,&mdash;others
employed the inner bark of trees, and others the skins of
animals rudely prepared,&mdash;the wasp was manufacturing a firm
and durable paper. Even when the papyrus was rendered more
fit, by a process of art, for the transmission of ideas in writing.
The paper of the papyrus was formed of the leaves of the plant,
dried, pressed, and polished; <i>the wasp alone knew how to
reduce vegetable fibres to a pulp, and then unite them by a
size or glue, spreading the substance out into a smooth and
delicate leaf</i>. This is exactly the process of paper-making. It
would seem that the wasp knows, as the modern paper-makers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
now know, that the fibres of rags, whether linen or cotton, are
not the only materials that can be used in the formation of
paper; she employs other vegetable matters, converting them
into a proper consistency by her assiduous exertions. In some
respects she is more skilful even than our paper-makers, for she
takes care to retain her fibres of sufficient length, by which she
renders her paper as strong as she requires. Many manufacturers
of the present day cut their material into small bits, and
thus produce a rotten article. One great distinction between
good and bad paper is its toughness; and this difference is
invariably produced by the fibre of which it is composed being
long, and therefore tough; or short, and therefore friable.</p>

<p>The wasp has been laboring at her manufacture of paper,
from her first creation, with precisely the same instruments and
the same materials; and her success has been unvarying. Her
machinery is very simple, and therefore it is never out of order.
She learns nothing, and forgets nothing. Men, from time to
time, lose their excellence in particular arts, and they are slow
in finding out real improvements. Such improvements are
often the effect of accident. Paper is now manufactured very
extensively by machinery, in all its stages; and thus, instead of
a single sheet being made by hand, a stream of paper is poured
out, which would form a roll large enough to extend round the
globe, if such a length were desirable. The first experimenters
on paper machinery in England, Messrs. Fourdrinier, it is said,
spent the enormous sum of 40,000<i>l.</i> in vain attempts to render
the machine capable of determining the width of the roll; and,
at last, accomplished their object at the suggestion of a bystander,
by a strap revolving upon an axis, at a cost of <i>three shillings
and sixpence</i>! Such is the difference between the workings of
human knowledge and experience, and those of animal instinct.
We proceed slowly and in the dark&mdash;but our course is not
bounded by a narrow line, for it seems difficult to say what is
the perfection of any art; animals go clearly to a given point&mdash;but
they can go no further. We may, however, learn something
from their perfect knowledge of what is within their range.
<i>It is not improbable that if man had attended in an earlier
state of society to the labors of wasps, he would have sooner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
known how to make paper</i>. We are still behind in our arts
and sciences, because we have not always been observers. If
we had watched the operations of insects, and the structure of
insects in general, with more care, we might have been far
advanced in the knowledge of many arts which are yet in their
infancy, for nature has given us abundance of patterns. We
have learnt to perfect some instruments of sound by examining
the structure of the human ear; and the mechanism of an
eye has suggested some valuable improvements in achromatic
glasses.</p>

<p>Réaumur has given a very interesting account of the wasps
of Cayenne (<i>Chartergus nidulans</i>), which hang their nests in
trees<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. Like the bird of Africa called the social grosbeak (<i>Loxia
socia</i>), they fabricate a perfect house, capable of containing
many hundreds of their community, and suspend it on high out
of the reach of attack. But the Cayenne wasp is a more expert
artist than the bird. He is <i>a pasteboard-maker</i>;&mdash;and the
card with which he forms the exterior covering of his abode is
so smooth, so strong, so uniform in its texture, and so white that
the most skilful manufacturer of this substance might be proud
of the work. It takes ink admirably!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_582" href="#FNanchor_582" class="label">[582]</a> Mémoires sur les Insectes, tom. vi., mem. vii. See also Bonnet, vol. ix.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The nest of the pasteboard-making wasp is impervious to
water. It hangs upon the branch of a tree, and those rain-drops
which penetrate through the leaves never rest upon its
hard and polished surface. A small opening for the entrance
of the insects terminates its funnel-shaped bottom. It is
impossible to unite more perfectly the qualities of lightness and
strength.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Rennie, speaking of wasps’ nests, gives us the following
interesting account of one lately examined by him:&mdash;“The
length,” says he, “is about nine inches, six stout circular platforms
stretch internally across, like so many floors, and fixed all
round to the walls of the nest. They are smooth above, with
hexagonal cells on the under surface. These platforms are not
quite flat, but rather concave above, like a watch-glass reversed;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
the centre of each platform is perforated for the admission of
the wasps, at the extremity of a short funnel-like projection, and
through this access is gained from story to story. On each
platform, therefore, can the wasps walk leisurely about, attending
to the pupæ secured in the cells, which, with the mouths
downward, cover the ceiling above their heads&mdash;the height of
the latter being just convenient for their work.”</p>

<p>Pendent wasps’-nests of enormous size are found in Ceylon,
suspended often in the talipot-tree at the height of seventy feet.
The appearance of these nests thus elevated, with the larger
leaves of the tree, used by the natives as umbrellas and tents,
waving over them, is very singular. Though no species of
European wasp is a storer of honey, yet this rule does not apply
to certain species of South America. In the “Annals and
Magazine of Natural History” for June, 1841, will be found a
detailed account, with a figure of the pendent nest of a species
termed by Mr. A. White <i>Myraptera scutellaris</i>. The external
case consists of stout cardboard covered with conical knobs of
various sizes. The entrances are artfully protected by pent-roofs
from the weather and heavy rains; and are tortuous, so
as to render the ingress of a moth or other large insect difficult.
Internally are fourteen combs, exclusive of a globular mass,
the nucleus of several circular combs, which are succeeded
by others of an arched form&mdash;that is, constituting segments of
circles.</p>

<p>Good writing, printing and wrapping paper, may be procured
from the shavings of common wood. The wood must be
reduced to shavings by the ordinary jack-plain shaving size.
The shavings are then placed in a cistern or boiler sufficiently
large, and covered with water, which should be raised to the
boiling-point. To every one hundred pounds of the wood so
reduced, from twelve to eighteen pounds of alkali, either vegetable
or mineral, is to be added, in proportion to its quality for
strength. If salts are used they should be reduced before
coming in contact with the wood. The salts may, however, be
put in with the water and wood before reduction, but the first
method is the most preferable. Should lime be used, there must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
be a sufficient, in all cases, to equal twelve pounds of pure black
salts. One hundred pounds of wood will, if well attended to,
make from five to seven reams of paper<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_583" href="#FNanchor_583" class="label">[583]</a> Mr. Edmund Shaw, of Fenchurch Street, London, obtained a patent in England
bearing date September 14, 1837, for a method of manufacturing paper from
the leaves which cover the ears of Indian-corn.</p>

<p>According to this patent the envelopes or leaves which cover the corn are in
the first instance put into a vessel containing water. The water may be pure or
slightly alkaline; the water is then boiled in the vessel into which the aforesaid
envelopes or fellicular leaves are thrown, after being macerated. When they
have imbibed water and become thickened and swollen, so that the matter interposed
between the fibres is reduced to a state of pulp or jelly, a slight beating by
fulling, mallet, or other mechanical means will effect a separation of the fibre
from the adherent glutinous matter, and washing or rinsing with water during the
beating, will cleanse it entirely from the glutinous matter.</p>

<p>The fibre is then bleached, by immersing, or immersing and beating or stirring
it about in a solution of chloride of lime, or with beating engines, as at present
practised for the bleaching of rags in paper mills, and the fibre is in like manner
reduced to pulp, and paper manufactured therefrom, or the quality of the paper
may be varied by the admixture of a portion of rags or other filamentous substance.</p>

<p>It may be well to remark, that some attempts to produce paper from the above
mentioned material, have been made, but were abandoned from the incapability
of producing good white paper.</p>

<p>The patentee claims the mode, or process, above described of making white paper
by the application of bleached pulp, produced from the stalks or leaves of Indian-corn.</p>

</div>

<p>There seems no reason to question the correctness of Professor
Beckmann’s observation<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>, that the making of felt was invented
<i>before</i> weaving<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>. The middle and northern regions of
Asia are occupied by Tartars and other populous nations, whose
manners and customs appear to have continued unchanged
from the most remote antiquity<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>, and to whose simple and uniform
mode of existence this article seems to be as necessary as
food. Felt is the principal substance both of their clothing and
of their habitations. Carpini, who in the year 1246 went as
ambassador to the great Khan of the Moguls, Mongals, or
Tartars, says, “Their houses are round, and artificially made
like tents, of rods and twigs interwoven, having a round hole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>in the middle of the roof for the admission of light and the passage
of smoke, <i>the whole being covered with felt, of which
likewise the doors are made</i><a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.” Very recently the same account
of these “portable tents of felt” has been given by Julius
von Klaproth<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>. Kupffer says of the Caratchai, “Leurs larges
manteaux de feutre leur servent en même tems de matelas et
de couverture<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.” The large mantle of felt, here mentioned, is
used for the same purpose in the neighboring country of Circassia<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>.
One of these mantles now in the possession of Mr.
Urquhart was made of black goats’-hair, and had on the outside
a long shaggy villus. The Circassians sleep under this
mantle by night, and wear it, when required, over their other
dress by day. A similar article is thus described by Colonel
Leake<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>: the postillions in Phrygia “wear a cloak of white
camels’-hair, <i>half an inch thick</i>, and so stiff that the cloak
stands without support, when set upright on the ground. There
are neither sleeves nor hood; but only holes to pass the hands
through, and projections like wings upon the shoulders for the
purpose of turning off the rain. It is the manufacture of the
country.” The Chinese traveller, Chy Fa Hian, who visited
India at the end of the fourth century, says, that the people of
Chen Chen, a kingdom in a mountainous district situated about
the Lake of Lob, wore dresses like those of the Chinese, except
that they made use of felt and stuffs (<i>du feutre et des étoffes</i><a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>).</p>

<p>The account which Herodotus gives (iv. 23) of the habitations of the Argippæi
evidently alludes to customs similar to those of the modern Tartars. He says,
“They live under trees, covering the tree in winter with strong and thick undyed
felt (πίλῳ στεγνῷ λευκῷ), and removing the felt in summer.” Among the ceremonies
observed by the Scythians in burying the dead, Herodotus also mentions the
erection of three stakes of wood, which were surrounded with a close covering of
woollen felt (iv. 73). Also, in the next section but one (iv. 75.) there is an evident
allusion to the practice of living under tents made of felt (ὑποδύνουσι ὑπὸ τοὺς

<p>In conformity with the prevailing use of this manufacture in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
the colder regions of Asia, scarlet or purple felt (such as that
lately <i>re-invented</i> at Leeds, in England), was used by the
Babylonish decorators for the drapery of the funeral pile, when
Alexander celebrated the splendid obsequies of Hephæstion: for
so we must understand the expression φοινικίδες πιληταί (Diod. Sic.
xvii. 115. p. 251, Wess.). Xenophon (<i>Cycrop.</i> v. 5. § 7.)
mentions the use of felt manufactured in Media, <i>as a covering
for chairs and couches</i>. The Medes also used bags and sacks
of felt (Athenæus, 1. xii. p. 540 <i>c.</i> Casaub.).</p>

<p>The process, by which wool is converted into felt, was called
by the Greeks πίλησις (Plato <i>de Leg.</i> 1. viii. p. 115. ed. Bekker),
literally a compression, from πιλέω, to compress<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>. The
ancient Greek scholion on the passage of Plato here referred
to thus explains the term:  Πιλήσεως· τῆς διὰ τῆς τῶν ἐρίων πυκνώσεως
γινομένης ἐσθῆτος, <i>i. e.</i> “cloth made by the thickening of wool.”
With this definition of felt agrees the following description of a
 πέτασος in a Greek epigram, which records the dedication of it to
Mercury:&mdash;</p>

<p>The art of felting was called ἡ πιλητικὴ, (Plato, <i>Polit.</i> ii. 2. p. 296,
ed. Bekker). According to the ancient Greek and Latin glossaries,
and to Julius Pollux (vii. 30), a felt-maker, or hatter, was
 πιλοποιὸς or πιλωτοποιὸς, in Latin <i>coactiliarius</i>. From πῖλος (<i>dim.</i>
 πίλιον, <i>second dim.</i> πιλίδιον), the proper term for <i>felt</i> in general,
derived from the root of πιλέω, came the verb πιλόω, signifying <i>to
felt</i>, or <i>to make felt</i>, and from this latter verb was formed the
ancient participle πιλωτὸς, <i>felted</i>, which again gave origin to
 πιλωτοποιός.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that our English word <i>felt</i> is evidently
a participle or a derivative, and that its verb or root <span class="smcap">Fel</span> appears
to be the same with the root of πιλέω.</p>

<p>The Latin <i>cogo</i>, which was used, like the Greek πιλέω, to denote
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
the act of compressing, or forcing the separate hairs together,
gave origin to the participle <i>coactus</i>, and its derivative
<i>coactilis</i>. Pliny (H. N. viii. 48. s. 73.), after speaking of
woven stuffs, mentions in the following terms the use of wool
for making felt: “Lanæ et per se coactæ (<i>al.</i> coactam) vestem
ficiunt,” <i>i. e.</i> “Parcels of wool, driven together by themselves,
make cloth.” This is a very exact, though brief description of
the process of felting. The following monumental inscription
(Gruter, p. 648, n. 4.) contains the title <i>Lanarius coactiliarius</i>,
meaning <i>a manufacturer of woollen felt:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Ballorius M. L. Lariseus, Lanarius coactiliarius,
conjuga carissimæ B. M. fec.</span></p>

<p>Helvius Successus, the son of a freed man, and the father
of the Roman emperor Pertinax, was a hatter in Liguria
(<i>tabernam coactiliariam in Liguria exercuerat</i>, Jul. Cap.
<i>Pertinax</i>, c. 3.). Pertinax himself, being fond of money, having
the perseverance expressed by his agnomen, and having
doubtless, in the course of his expeditions into the East, made
valuable observations respecting the manufacture which he
had known from his boyhood, continued and extended the
same business, carrying it on and conveying his goods to a distance
by the agency of slaves. The Romans originally received
the use of felt together with its name<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> from the Greeks
(Plutarch, <i>Numa</i>, p. 117, ed. Steph.). The Greeks were acquainted
with it as early as the age of Homer, who lived about
900 B. C. (<i>Il.</i> x. 265), and Hesiod (<i>Op. et Dies</i>, 542, 546).</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_594" href="#FNanchor_594" class="label">[594]</a> <i>Pileus</i> or <i>Pileum</i> (Non. Marc. iii., <i>pilea virorum sunt</i>, Servius <i>in Virg. Æn.</i>
ix. 616.), dim. <i>Pileolus</i> or <i>Pileolum</i> (Colum. <i>de Arbor.</i> 25).</p>

</div>

<p>The principal use of felt among the Greeks and Romans
was to make coverings of the head for the male sex, and the
most common cover made of this manufacture was a simple
skull-cap, <i>i. e.</i> a cap exactly fitted to the shape of the head, as
is shown in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> fig. 1. taken from a sepulchral bas-relief
which was found by Mr. Dodwell in Bœotia<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>. The original is
as large as life. The person represented appears to have been
a Cynic philosopher. He leans upon the staff (<i>baculus</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
 βάκτρον, σκῆπτρον); he is clothed in the blanket (<i>pallium</i>,  χλαῖνα,
τρίβων) with one end, which is covered, over his left breast, and
another hanging behind over his left shoulder; he wears the
beard (<i>barba</i>, πώγων); his head is protected by the simple skull-cap
(<i>pileus</i>, πῖλος). All these were distinct characteristics of
the philosopher, and more especially of the Cynic<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>. The dog
also probably marked his sect. Leonidas of Tarentum, in his
enumeration of the goods belonging to the Cynic Posochares
<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>,
including a dog-collar (κυνοῦχον), mentions,  καὶ πῖλον κεφαλᾶς οὔχ ὁσίας
σκεπανὸν, <i>i. e.</i> “The cap of felt, which covered his unholy head.”
This passage may be regarded as a proof, that among the
Greeks, though not among the Romans, the cap of felt was
worn by very poor men. It also proves that this cap, which
was the <i>fess</i> of the modern Greeks, was worn by philosophers,
and therefore throws light on a passage of Antiphanes (<i>ap.
Athen.</i> xii. 63. p. 545 a) describing a philosopher of a different
character, who was very elegantly dressed, having a small cap
of fine felt (πιλίδιον ἁπαλὸν), also a small white blanket, a beautiful
tunic, and a neat stick. When Cleanthes advanced the doctrine,
<i>that the moon had the shape of a skull-cap</i> (πιλοειδῆ τῷ
σχήματι, Stobæi <i>Ecl. Phys.</i> 1. 27. p. 554, ed. Heeren), he probably
intended to account for its phases from its supposed hemispherical
form. A cap of a similar form and appearance, though
perhaps larger and not so closely fitted to the crown of the
head, was worn by fishermen<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. In an epigram of Philippus<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>,
describing the apparatus of a fisherman, the author mentions
 πῖλον ἀμφίκρηνον ὑδασιστεγῆ, “the cap encompassing his head and
protecting it from wet.” Figure 2. in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> represents a
small statue of a fisherman belonging to the Townley Collection
in the British Museum. His cap is slightly pointed and in a
degree, which was probably favorable to the discharge of water
from its surface. Hesiod recommends, that agricultural laborers
should wear the same defence from cold and showers (<i>Op. et
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
Dies</i>, 545-547). The use of this cap by seamen was no
doubt the ground, on which the painter Nicomachus represented
Ulysses wearing one. “Hic primus,” says Pliny (H. N. xxxv.
36. s. 22.), “Ulyssi addidit pileum<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.” For the same reason the
cap is an attribute of the Dioscuri; and hence two caps with
stars above them are often shown on the coins of maritime
cities and of others where Castor and Pollux were worshipped.
Figure 3. of <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> is taken from a brass coin of Dioscurias
in Colchis, preserved in the British Museum. On the reverse
is the name ΔΙΟΣΚΟΥΡΙΑΔΟΣ. Figure 4. represents both sides
of a silver coin in the same collection, with the legend
 ΒΡΕΤΤΙΩΝ. It belongs to Bruttium in South Italy. On the
one side Castor and Pollux are mounted on horseback. They
wear the chlamys and carry palm branches in their hands.
Their caps have a narrow brim. The reverse shows their
heads only, and their caps, without brims, are surrounded by
wreaths of myrtle. The cornucopia is added as an emblem
of prosperity. Figure 5. is from a brass coin of Amasia
(ΑΜΑΣΣΕΙΑΣ) in Pontus. It shows the cornucopia between the
two skull-caps. Charon also was represented with the mariner’s
or fishermen’s cap, as, for example, in the bas-relief in the
<i>Museo Pio-Clementino</i>, tom. iv. tav. 35, and the painted vase
in Stackelberg’s <i>Grüber der Hellenen</i>, t. 47, 48, which is
copied in Becker s <i>Charicles</i>, vol. ii. taf. i. fig. 1, and in Smith’s
<i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</i>, p. 404.</p>

<p>A pileus of the same general form was worn by artificers;
and on this account it was attributed to Vulcan and to Dædalus,
who, as well as Ulysses and Charon, are commonly found
wearing it in works of ancient art. Arnobius says, that Vulcan
was represented “cum pileo et malleo”&mdash;“fabrili expeditione
succinctus;” and that on the other hand Mercury was
represented with the petasus, or “petasunculus,” on his head.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
This observation is confirmed by numerous figures of these
two divinities, if we suppose the term <i>petasus</i>, which will be
more fully illustrated hereafter, to have meant a hat with a
brim, and <i>pileus</i> to have denoted properly a fessor cap without
a brim.</p>

<p>According to Herodotus the Scythians had felted coverings for their tents, a
custom still found among their successors, the Tartars. Felting appears to have
preceded weaving. It is certainly a much ruder and simpler process: and, when
we consider both the long prevalence of the art among the pastoral inhabitants of
the ancient Scythia, and the extensive use of its products among them so as to be
employed even for their habitations, perhaps we shall be right in considering felting
as the appropriate invention of this people.</p>

<p>The wig (<i>galerus</i>) answered the same purpose for the wealthy
classes (<i>arrepto pileo vel galero</i>, Sueton. <i>Nero</i>, 26), and the
<i>cucullus</i> and <i>cudo</i> for both rich and poor. On returning home
from a party, a person sometimes carried his cap and slippers
under his arm (Hor. <i>Epist.</i> l. xiii. 15).</p>

<p>The hats worn by the Salii<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> are said by Dionysius of Halicarnassus
to have been “tall hats of a conical form<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>.” Plutarch
distinctly represents them as made of felt. He says (<i>l.
c.</i>), that the <i>flamines</i> were so called <i>quasi pilamines</i>, because
they wore felt hats, and because in the early periods of Roman
history it was more common to invent names derived from the
Greek. On coins, however, this official cap of the Salii and
Flamines is commonly oval like that attributed to the Dioscuri.
We observe indeed continual variations in the form of the pileus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
from hemispherical to oval, and from oval to conical. A
conical cap is seen on the head of the reaper in the wood-cut to
the article <span class="smcap">Flax</span> in Smith’s <i>Dictionary</i> of Greek and Roman
Antiquities, which wood-cut is taken from a coin of one of the
Lagidæ, kings of Egypt. Caps, regularly conical and still
more elongated, are worn by the buffoons or comic dancers,
who are introduced in an ancient mosaic preserved in the Villa
Corsini at Rome<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>. Telephus, king of Mysia, is represented as
wearing a “Mysian cap<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>.” This “Mysian cap” must have
been the same which is known by the moderns under the name
of <i>the Phrygian bonnet</i>, and with which we are familiar
from the constant repetition of it in statues and paintings of
Priam, Paris, Ganymede<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>, Atys, Perseus, and Mithras, and in
short in all the representations not only of Trojans and Phrygians,
but of Amazons and of all the inhabitants of Asia Minor,
and even of nations dwelling still further to the East. Also,
when we examine the works of ancient art which contain representations
of this Mysian cap, we perceive that it was a cone
bent into the form in which it is exhibited, and so bent, perhaps
by use, but more probably by design. This circumstance is
well illustrated in a bust of Parian marble, supposed to be intended
for Paris, which is preserved in the Glyptotek at Munich.
A drawing of it is given in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> fig. 13. The flaps of
the bonnet are turned up and fastened over the top of the head.
The stiffness of the material is clearly indicated by the sharp
angular appearance of that portion of it which is turned forwards.
Mr. Dodwell, in his <i>Tour in Greece</i> (vol. i. p. 134),
makes the following observations on the modern costume, which
seems to resemble the ancient, except that the ancient πῖλος and
 πιλίδιον were probably of undyed wool:&mdash;“The Greeks of the
maritime parts, and particularly of the islands, wear a red or
blue cap of a conical form, like the pilidion. When it is new
it stands upright, but it soon bends, and then serves as a pocket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
for the handkerchief, and sometimes for the purse. Others
wear the red skull-cap, or <i>fess</i>.” The Lycians, as we are informed
by Herodotus (viii. 92), wore caps of felt, which were
surrounded with feathers. Some of the Lycian coins and bas-reliefs,
however, show the “Phrygian bonnet,” as it is called,
in the usual form<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>.</p>

<p>The cap worn by the Persians is called by Greek authors
 κυρβασία or τιάρα<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>, and seems to have had the form now under consideration.
Herodotus, when he describes the costume of the
Persian soldiers in the army of Xerxes, says, that they wore
light and flexible caps of felt, which were called <i>tiaras</i>. He
adds, that the Medes and Bactrians wore the same kind of cap
with the Persians, but that the Cissii wore a mitra instead (vii.
61, 62, 64). On the other hand he says, that the Sacæ wore
<i>cyrbasiæ</i>, which were sharp-pointed, straight, and compact.
The Armenians were also called “weavers of felt” (Brunck,
<i>Anal.</i> ii. p. 146. No. 22). The form of their caps is clearly
shown in the coins of the Emperor Verus, one of which, preserved
in the British Museum, is engraved in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> fig. 14.
The legend, surrounding his head, <span class="smcap">L. Vervs. Avg. Armeniacvs</span>,
refers to the war in Armenia. The reverse shows a female
figure representing Armenia, mourning and seated on the
ground, and surrounded by the emblems of Roman warfare and
victory. The caps represented on this and other coins agree
remarkably with the forms still used in the same parts of Asia.
Strabo (L. xi. p. 563, ed. Sieb.) says, that these caps were
necessary in Media on account of the cold. He calls the Persian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
cap “felt in the shape of a tower” (L. xv. p. 231). The
king of Persia was distinguished by wearing a stiff cyrbasia,
which stood erect, whereas his subjects wore their tiaras
folded and bent forwards.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Hence in the <i>Aves</i> of Aristophanes
the cock is ludicrously compared to the Great King, his erect
comb being called his “cyrbasia.” The Athenians no doubt
considered this form of the tiara as an expression of pride and
assumption. It is recorded as one of the marks of arrogance in
Apollodorus, the Athenian painter, that he wore an “erect cap<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>.”</p>

<p>The coin represented in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> fig. 15. (taken from Patin,
<i>Imp. Rom. Numismata</i>, Par. 1697, p. 213) is of the reign of
the Emperor Commodus, and belonged according to the legend
either to Trapezus in Cappadocia or to Trapezopolis in Caria.
It represents the god Lunus or Mensis, who was the moon considered
as of the male sex agreeably to the ideas of many northern
and Asiatic nations (Patin, p. 173). This male moon or month
was, as it seems, always represented with the cyrbasia<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>. In
another coin published by Patin (<i>l. c.</i>) a cock stands at the feet
of this divinity, proving that this was the sacred bird of Lunus,
and probably because the rayed form of the cock’s comb was
regarded as a natural type of the cyrbasia, which distinguished
the kings of Persia and was attributed also to this Oriental
divinity. A lamp found on the Celian Mount at Rome<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> represents
in the centre Lunus with 12 rays, probably designed to
denote the 12 months of the year, and on the handle two
cocks pecking at their food. A head of the same divinity, published
by Hirt (<i>l. c.</i>) from an antique gem at Naples, has 7 stars
upon the cap, perhaps referring to the 7 planets.</p>

<p>Instead of the conical cap of the Asiatics many of the Northern
nations of Europe appear to have worn a felt cap, the form
of which was that of a truncated cone. Of this a good example
is shown in the group of Sarmatians, represented in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
wood-cut in Smith s <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities</i>
(p. 160), which is taken from the Column of Trajan.
The same thing appears in various coins belonging to the
reign of this Emperor, two of which, preserved in the British
Museum, are engraved in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> fig. 16. represents Dacia
sitting as a captive with her hands tied behind her back, wearing
trowsers (<i>braccæ</i>) and a conical or oval cap with the edge
turned up. Figure 17. represents Dacia mourning. In each
we see a Dacian target together with Roman armor. Each
has the same legend, <span class="smcap">Dac. Cap. Cos. V. P. P. S. P. Q. R.

<p>According to the representation of Lucian (<i>de Gymnas.</i>),
the Scythians were in the constant habit of wearing caps or
hats: for in the conversation between Anacharsis and Solon
described by that author, Anacharsis requests to go into the
shade, saying that he could scarce endure the sun, and that he
had brought his cap (πῖλον) from home, but did not like being
seen alone in a strange habit. In later times we read of
the “pileati Gothi” and “pileati sacerdotes Gothorum<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.”</p>

<p>In considering the use of the skull-cap, or of the conical cap
of felt, it remains to notice the use of it among the Romans as
the emblem of liberty<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>. When a slave obtained his freedom
he had his head shaven, and wore instead of his hair the pileus,
or cap of undyed felt, (Diod. Sic. Exc. Leg. 22. p. 625, ed.
Wess.). Plutarch, in allusion to the same custom, calls the cap
 πιλίον, which is the diminutive of πῖλος. It is evident, that the
Latin <i>pileus</i> or <i>pileum</i> is derived from the Greek πῖλος and its
diminutive, and this circumstance in conjunction with other evidence
tends to show, that the Latins adopted this use of felt
from the Greeks. Sosia says in Plautus (<i>Amphit.</i> i. l, 306), as a
description of the mode of receiving his liberty, “Ut ego hodie,
raso capite calvus, capiam pileum.” Servius (<i>in Virg. Æn.</i>
viii. 564) says, the act of manumitting slaves in this form was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
done in the temple of Feronia, who was the goddess of freedmen.
In her temple at Terracina was a stone seat, on which
was engraved the following verse:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Benemeriti servi sedeant, surgent liberi.”</p>

<p>In allusion to this practice it appears that the Romans, though
they did not commonly wear hats, put them on at the Saturnalia.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
At the death of Nero, the common people to express their
joy went about the city in felt caps.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> In allusion to this custom
the figure of Liberty on the coins of Antoninus Pius holds
the cap in her right hand. Figures 1 and 2 in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> are
examples selected from the collection in the British Museum,
and, as we learn from the legend, were struck when he was
made consul the fourth time, <i>i. e.</i> A. D. 145.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the various forms of the felt cap now
described and represented, all of which were more or less elevated,
and many of which were pointed upwards, we have now
to consider those, which, though made of felt, and therefore
classed by the ancients under the general terms <i>pileus</i>, πῖλος,
&amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> corresponded more nearly to our modern <i>hat</i>. The
Greek word πέτασος, <i>dim.</i> πετάσιον, derived from πετάννυμι, <i>extendo</i>,
<i>dilato</i>, and adopted by the Latins in the form <i>petasus</i>, dim.
<i>petasunculus</i>, well expressed the distinctive form of these hats.
They were more or less broad and expanded. What was
taken from their height was added to their width. Those already
mentioned had no brim; the petasus of every variety
had a brim, which was either exactly or nearly circular, and
which varied greatly in its width. In some cases it seems to
be a mere circular disc without any crown at all. Of this we
have an example in a beautiful statue, which has, no doubt,
been meant for Endymion, in the Townley collection of the
British Museum. See <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> Fig. 3. His right hand encircles
his head, and his scarf is spread over a rock as described
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
by Lucian<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>. He sleeps upon it, holding the fibula in his left
hand. His feet are adorned with boots (<i>cothumi</i>) and his simple
petasus is tied under his chin. In this form the petasus illustrates
the remark of Theophrastus, who, in describing the
Egyptian Bean, says, that the leaf was of the size of the Thessalian
petasus<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>. For the purpose of comparing these two objects,
a representation of the leaves of the plant referred to, is introduced
into the same Figure (3); taken from the “Botanical
Magazine,” Plates 903, 3916, and Sir J. E. Smith’s “Exotic
Botany,” Tab. 31, 32. The petasus here shown on the head
of Endymion, the original statue being as large as life, certainly
resembles very closely both in size and in form the leaf of
the Egyptian Bean, which is the Cyamus Nelumbo, or Nelumbium
Speciosum of modern botanists.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_622" href="#FNanchor_622" class="label">[622]</a> In the Dialogues of the Gods (xi.), the Moon says in answer to Venus, that
Endymion is particularly beautiful “when he sleeps, having thrown his scarf
under him upon the rock, holding in his left hand the darts just falling from it,
whilst his right hand bent upwards lies gracefully round his face, and, dissolved
in sleep, he exhales his ambrosial breath.”</p>

<p>The recumbent statue, here represented, is of white marble, and is placed in
room XI. of the Townley Gallery. It was found in 1774 at Roma Vecchia (Dallaway’s
<i>Anecdotes of the Arts</i>, p. 303). It has been called Mercury or Adonis.
But there are no examples or authorities in support of either of these suppositions.
It is not sufficient to say that every beautiful youth may have been meant either
for Mercury, who was never represented asleep, or for Adonis. We know that
the fable of Endymion and the Moon was a favorite subject with the ancient artists.
In the <i>Antichita d’Ercolano</i>, tom. iii. tav. 3, we find a picture, which was
discovered at Portica, and which represents this subject. It is still more frequent
in ancient bas-reliefs. See <i>Mus. Pio-Clem.</i> tom. iv. v. 8, pp. 38, 41; Sandrart,

<p>This pastoral hat, if we may judge from the representation

wears a flat and very broad petasus hanging behind his neck.

<p>In consequence of the use of the petasus as a part of the
ordinary costume of the Athenian youth, we find it in a great
variety of works of ancient art illustrative of the religion and
mythology of Greece. For example:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In the inner frieze of the Parthenon, the remains of which
are now in the British Museum, it is worn by many of the
riders on horseback. Figure 7, in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate IX.</a> shows one of
these horsemen (from the slab No. 54.) with his petasus tied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
under his chin.</p>

<p>2. It is worn by Theseus, as represented on a vase in the
Vatican collection. See Winckelmann, <i>Mon. Inediti</i>, vol. ii.
98, and Fig. 8, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a></p>

<p>3. Also by Œdipus, as represented on one of Sir William
Hamilton’s vases (vol. ii. Plate 24.), standing before the sphinx.</p>

<p>4. The coins of Ætolia exhibit Meleager wearing the petasus.
Five of these have been selected from the collection in the
British Museum, which are engraved according to the size of
the originals in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> Figures 9, 10, and 11, are of silver.
In each of them the petasus has the form of a circular disc with
a boss at the top like that on a Scotch bonnet: on the reverse
is the Calydonian boar, with a spear head beneath it, and the
word ΑΙΤΩΛΩΝ. Figure 12, which is of gold<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>, and Figure 13,
which is of silver, have the head of Hercules on the reverse.
The hero, supposed to be Meleager, wears a petasus, a scarf, and
boots, as we have seen to be the case with Endymion (Fig. 3),
this being the attire of hunters. In these two coins he also
holds a spear in his right hand, and is seated upon a shield
(see Fig. 13.) and other pieces of armor. ΑΙΤΩΛΩΝ is written
by the side. The gold coin (see Fig. 12.) represents him with
a Victory in his left hand, and with a small figure of Diana
Lucifera in front.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The broad-brimmed hat, or petasus, was more especially worn
by the Greeks when they were travelling<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>. Its appearance is
well shown in Fig. 14, taken from a fictile vase belonging to
the late Mr. Hope<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>. It represents a Greek soldier on a journey,
wearing his large blanket, and holding two spears in his right
hand. This figure also shows one of the methods of fastening
on the hat, viz. by passing the string round the occiput.</p>

<p>The comedies of Plautus, being translated from the Greek,
contain allusions to the same practice. In the Pseudolus (ii. 4.
55, and iv. 7. 90,) the petasus and the scarf are supposed to be
worn by a person to indicate that he was coming from a journey.

<p>Mercury and his father Jupiter are here supposed to be attired
like Sosia and Amphitryo his master, both of whom had been
travelling and were returning home. At the same time there
is an allusion to the winged hat of Mercury, of which more
hereafter. Again, in act i. scene i. l. 287, the petasus is
attributed to Sosia, because he is supposed to be coming from a
journey; and to Mercury, both because it was commonly
attributed to him, and because on this occasion he was personating
Sosia.</p>

<p>The Romans were less addicted to the use of the petasus
than the Greeks: they often wore it when they were from
home; but that they did not consider it at all necessary to wear
hats in the open air is manifest from the remark of Suetonius
about the Emperor Augustus, that he could not even bear the
winter’s sun, and hence “domi quoque non nisi petatasus sub
divo spatiabatur.” (<i>August.</i> 82.) Caligula permitted the
senators to wear them at the theatres as a protection from the
sun (Dio. Cass. lix. 7. p. 909, ed. Reimari). What was meant
by wearing hats “according to the Thessalian fashion” is by no
means clear. Perhaps the Thessalians may have worn hats
resembling those of their neighbors, the Macedonians, and of
the shape of these we may form some conception from the coins
of the Macedonian kings. One of these coins from the collection
in the British Museum is copied in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> Fig. 15.
It is a coin of the reign of Alexander I. and exhibits a Macedonian
warrior standing by the side of his horse, holding two
spears in his left hand, and wearing a hat with a broad brim
turned upwards. This Macedonian petasus is called the
<i>Causia</i> (καυσία)<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>, and was adopted by the Romans<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>, and more
especially by the Emperor Caracalla, who, as Herodian states,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
aimed to imitate Alexander the Great in his costume. It
appears probable, nevertheless, that the turning up of the brim
was not peculiar to the Macedonians, and it may have depended
altogether on accident or fancy; for we find instances of it on
painted fictile vases, where there is no reason to suppose that
any reference was intended either to Macedonia or Thessaly.
Fig. 16. <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> for example, is taken from the head of
Bellerophon, on one of Sir William Hamilton’s vases<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>; and the
left-hand figure from a fictile vase at Vienna, engraved by
Ginzrot<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>. This hat is remarkable for the boss at the top, which
we observe also on the Ætolian coins, and in various other
examples.</p>

<p>In connection with the above quoted expression of Dio Cassius
it may be observed further, that besides the <i>causia</i> two
varieties of the petasus seem to be alluded to by several ancient
authors, viz. the Thessalian, and the Arcadian or Laconian.
How they were distinguished, cannot be ascertained, but the
passages which mention them will now be produced, that the
reader may judge for himself. The Thessalian variety is
mentioned by Dio Cassius, by Theophrastus, as above quoted
(p. 427), and by Callimachus in the following fragment, which
is preserved in the Scholia on Sophocles, <i>Œd. Col.</i> 316.</p>

and also a native of Arcadia.</p>

<p>Herodes Atticus wore “the Arcadian hat” at Athens, as a
protection from the sun; and the language of Philostratus, in
recording the fact, shows that the Athenians of his time commonly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>

or Arcadian hats,” were worn in the army by the peltastæ
instead of helmets<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>. This circumstance shows a remarkable
change of customs; for in the early Greek history we find
the Persian soldiers held up as the objects of ridicule and contempt,
because they wore hats and trowsers<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>. On the whole, it
is very evident that “the Arcadian or Laconian hat” was one
and the same variety, and that this variety of head-dress was
simply the petasus, or hat with a brim, so called to distinguish
it from the proper πῖλος, which was the skull-cap, or hat without
a brim.</p>

<p>This supposition suits the representations of the only imaginary
beings who are exhibited in works of ancient art wearing
the petasus, viz. the Dioscuri and Mercury.</p>

<p>It has been already observed that the Dioscuri are commonly
represented with the skull-cap, because they were worshipped,
as the reader will have perceived, as the guardians of the mariner<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>;
but on ancient vases we find them sometimes painted
with the petasus; and if this was the same with the πῖλος Λακωνικὸς,
it would coincide with their origin as natives of Sparta. In
<a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> Fig. 16, an example is shown, on one of Sir William
Hamilton’s vases, in which their attire resembles that of
the Athenian ephebi. They wear boots and a tunic, over
which one of them also wears the scarf or chlamys. They
are conducted by the goddess Night.</p>

<p>In like manner Mercury, as a native of Arcadia, might be
expected to wear “the Arcadian hat.” In the representations
of this deity on works of ancient art, the hat, which is often
decorated with wings to indicate his office of messenger, as his
talaria also did<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>, has a great variety of forms, and sometimes
the brim is so narrow, that it does not differ from the cap of the
artificer already described, or the πῖλος in its ordinary form.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
These hats, with a brim of but small dimensions, agree most
exactly in appearance with the cheapest hats of undyed felt,
now made in the United States and Great Britain<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>. On the
heads of the rustics and artificers in our streets and lanes
we often see forms the exact counterpart of those which we
most admire in the works of ancient art. The petasus is also
still commonly worn by agricultural laborers in Greece and Asia
Minor.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_642" href="#FNanchor_642" class="label">[642]</a> Servius (on <i>Virg. Æn.</i> viii. 138) says, that Mercury was supposed to have

<p>A bas-relief in the Vatican collection<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>, represents the birth of
Hercules, and contains two figures of Mercury. In one he carries
the infant Hercules, in the other the caduceus. In both he
wears a large scarf, and a skull-cap, like that of Dædalus<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>,
without a brim. This example therefore proves that, although
the petasus, as distinguished from the pileus, was certainly the
appropriate attribute of Mercury<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>, yet the artists of antiquity
sometimes took the liberty of placing on his head the skull-cap
instead of the hat, just as we have seen that they sometimes
made the reverse substitution in the case of the Dioscuri.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the person who acted the part of a Silenus in the Dionysiac
procession instituted by Ptolemy Philadelphus at Alexandria, wore a hat and
a golden caduceus (<i>Athen.</i> v. 27. p. 198 A.). In this case the imagination appears
to have been indulged in decorating a mere festive character with the peculiar
attributes of Mercury. It is added, that various kinds of chariots were driven
by “boys wearing the tunics of charioteers and petasi” (<i>Athen.</i> v. p. 200 F.). This
would be in character, being agreeable to the custom of the Grecian youth.</p>

<p>The following is from a sepulchral urn found near Padua (<i>Gruter.</i> <i>p.</i> 297):</p>

<p>Another bas-relief in the Vatican<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>, represents the story of
the birth of Bacchus <i>from Jupiter’s thigh</i>. Thus the subject
of it is very similar to that, which relates to the birth of Hercules,
the infant being in each instance consigned to the care
of Mercury. But the covering of Mercury’s head in these two
cases is remarkably different, though from no other reason than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
the fancy of the artist. In the bas-relief now under consideration,
Mercury holds the skin of a lynx or panther to receive
the child. He wears the scarf or chlamys and cothumi. This
was a very favorite subject with the ancients. It occurs on a
superb marble vase with the inscription ΣΑΛΠΙΩΝ ΕΠΟΙΗΣΕ<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>,

<p>Besides the application of felt as a covering of the head for
the male sex in the manner now explained, it was also used as
<i>a lining for helmets</i>. When in the description of the helmet
worn by Ulysses we read</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Μέσσῃ δ’ ἐνὶ πῖλος ἀρήρει<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>,</p>

<p>we may suppose πῖλος to be used in its most ordinary sense,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
consequently that the interior of the helmet was a common
skull-cap.</p>

Homer, <i>Il.</i> x. 265. Eustathius, in his commentary on this passage, says, that
the most ancient Greeks always wore felt in their helmets, but that those of more
recent times, regarding this use of felt as peculiar to Ulysses, persuaded the painters
to exhibit him in a skull-cap, and that this was <i>first</i> done, according to the
tradition, by the painter <i>Apollidorus</i>. The account of Pliny, who, together with
Servius (<i>in Æn.</i> ii. 44), represents Nicomachus, and not Apollidorus, as having
first adopted this idea.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Being generally thicker than common cloth, felt presented a
more effectual obstacle to missile weapons. Hence, when the
soldiers under Julius Cæsar were much annoyed by Pompey’s
archers, they made shirts or other coverings of felt, and put
them on for their defence<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. Thucydides refers to the use of
similar means to protect the body from arrows<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>; and even
in besieging and defending cities felt was used, together with
hides and sackcloth, to cover the wooden towers and military
engines<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>.</p>

<p>Felt was also sometimes used to cover the bodies of quadrupeds.
According to Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>, the Greeks clothed their <i>molles
oves</i> either with skins or with pieces of felt; and the wool became
gray in consequence. The Persians used the same material
for the trappings of their horses (Plutarch, <i>Artax.</i> II. p.
1858. ed. Stephani).</p>

<p>The loose rude coverings for the feet called <i>Udones</i> were

<p>In concluding this investigation it may be proper to observe,
that, although πῖλος originally meant <i>felt</i>, and more especially
a skull-cap made of that manufacture, it was sometimes used,
at least by the later Greek authors, by an extension of its
meaning, to denote a cap of any other material. Thus Athenæus
(lib. vi. p. 274. Casaub.) speaking of the Romans, says,
that they wore about their heads πίλους προβατείων δερμάτων δασεῖς, <i>i. e.</i>
“thick caps made of sheep skins.”</p>

<p>The raw materials, of which the ancients made nets, were

that Jerome, when he is prescribing employment for monks,
says, “Texantur et <i>lina</i> capiendis piscibus<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>.” The operation
of netting, as well as that of platting, was expressed by the

<p><i>Retis</i> or <i>Rete</i> in Latin, and δίκτυον in Greek, were used to denote
nets in general. Thus in an epigram of Leonidas Tarentinus<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>,
three brothers, one of whom was a hunter, another a fowler,
and the third a fisherman, dedicate their nets to Pan. Several
imitations of this epigram remain by Alexander Ætolus<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>,
Antipater Sidonius<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>, Archias<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>, and others<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. In one of these
epigrams (Ἰουλιάνου Αἰγυπτίου) we find λίνα adopted as a general
term for nets instead of δίκτυα, no doubt for the reason above
stated. In another epigram<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> a hare is said to have been caught
in a net (δίκτυον). Aristophanes mentions nets by the same
denomination among the contrivances employed by the fowler<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>.
Fishing-nets are called δίκτυα

<p>Netting was applied in various ways in the construction of
<i>hen-coops</i> and aviaries; and such net-work is called <i>rete</i><a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>. It
was used to make pens for sheep by night. At the amphitheatres
it was sometimes placed over the podium. At a gladiatorial
show given by Nero, the net, thus used as a fence against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
the wild beasts, was knotted <i>with amber</i><a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>. The way in
which the net was used by the <i>Retiarii</i> is well known. The
head-dress called κεκρύφαλος, was a small net of fine flax, silk, or
gold thread, and was also called <i>reticulum</i><a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>. But by far the
most important application of net-work was to the kindred arts
of hunting and fishing: and besides the general terms used
alike in reference to both these employments, there are special
terms to be explained under each head.</p>

<p>The use of nets for catching birds was very limited, on
which account we find no appropriate name for fowlers’ nets<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>.
Nevertheless thrushes were caught in them<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>, and doves or
pigeons, with their limbs tied up, or fastened to the ground, or
with their eyes covered or put out, were confined in a net in
order that their cries might allure others into the snare<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>. An
account of the nets used by the Egyptians to catch birds is
given by Sir Gardner Wilkinson<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>, being derived from the
paintings found in the catacombs. The net commonly employed
for the purpose was the clap-net. Bird-traps were also
made by stretching a net over two semicircular frames, which,
being joined and laid open, approached to the form of a circle.
The trap was baited, and when a bird flew to it and seized the
bait, it was instantly caught by the sudden rising of the two
sides or flaps.</p>

<p>In hunting it was usual to extend nets in a curved line of
considerable length<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>, so as in part to surround a space, into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
which the beasts of chase, such as the boar, the wild goat, the
deer, the hare, the lion, and the bear might be driven through
the opening left on one side. Tibullus (iv. 3. 12) speaks of
inclosing woody hills for this purpose:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>younger</i> Pliny describes himself on one occasion sitting
beside the nets, while the hunters were pursuing the boars and
driving them into the snare (<i>Epist.</i> i. 6). In Euripides (<i>Bacc.</i>
821-832) we find the following beautiful description of a fawn,
which has been driven into the space inclosed by the nets, but
has leaped over them and escaped:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Here a Bacchanal, tossing her head into the air with gambols
and dancing, is said to be “like a fawn sporting in the green
delights of a meadow, when she has escaped the fearful chase
by leaping over the well-platted nets so as to be out of the
inclosure, whilst the shouting hunter has been urging his dogs
to run still more swiftly: by great efforts and with the rapidity
of the winds she bounds over a plain beside a river, pleased
with solitudes remote from man, and hides herself in the thickets
of an umbrageous forest.”</p>

<p>If hollows or valleys were inclosed<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>, the nets were no doubt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
extended only in those openings, through which it was possible
for the animals to escape. Also a river was of itself a sufficient
boundary:</p>

<p>The proper Latin term for the hunting-net, but more especially
for the purse-net, which will be hereafter described, was
<span class="smcap">Cassis</span>. “Cassis, genus venatorii retis.” Isidori Hispalensis
<i>Orig.</i> xix. 5. “Arctos rodere casses” is applied by Persius (v.
170) to a quadruped with incisor teeth caught in such a net
and striving to escape. See also Propertius as just quoted, and
the <i>Agamemnon</i> of Seneca and Virgil’s <i>Georgics</i> as quoted
below. <i>Cassis</i> seems to be derived from the root of <i>capere</i>
and <i>catch</i>. But <span class="smcap">Plaga</span> was also applied to hunting-nets, so
that Horace describes the hunting of the boar in the following
terms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Aut trudit acres hinc et hinc multa cane</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Apros in obstantes plagas.&mdash;<i>Epod.</i> ii. 31, 32.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lucretius (lib. v. 1251, 1252) aptly compares the setting up of
the <i>plagæ</i> to the planting of a hedge around the forest:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nam fovea atque igni prius est venarier ortum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quam sæpire plagis saltum, canibusque ciere.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the same manner <i>plagæ</i> is used in the <i>Hippolytus</i> of Seneca,
as above quoted, and in Pliny<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_681" href="#FNanchor_681" class="label">[681]</a> H. N. xix. 1. s. 2.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>To dispose the nets in the manner which has been described,
was called “retia ponere” (Virg. <i>Georg.</i> i. 307) or “retia tendere”
(Ovid, <i>Art. Amat.</i> i. 45).</p>

<p>In Homer a hunting-net is called λίνον πάναγρον, literally, “the
flax that catches everything<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>.” But the proper Greek term for
the hunting-net, corresponding to the Latin <i>cassis</i>, was ἄρκυς,
which is accordingly employed in the passages of Oppian and
Euripides cited above. Also the epigram of Antipater Sidonius,
to which a reference has already been made, specifies the
hunting-net by the same appellation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Δᾶμις μὲν θηρῶν ἄρκυν ὀρειονόμων.</p>
</div>

<p>The word is used in the same sense by Cratinus<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>; also by Arrian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
where he remarks that the Celts dispensed with the use of
nets in hunting, because they trusted to the swiftness of their
greyhounds<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>. In Euripides<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> it is used metaphorically: the children
cry out, when their mother is pursuing them,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this passage reference is made to the large shawl in which
Clytemnestra wrapt the body of Agamemnon, as in a net, in
order to destroy him. On account of the use made of it, the
same fatal garment is afterwards (l. 1353) compared to a casting-net,
which in its form bore a considerable resemblance to
the <i>cassis</i>. In l. 1346, ἀρκύστατα<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> denotes this net as set up
for hunting. The same form occurs again in the <i>Eumenides</i>
(l. 112); and in the <i>Persæ</i> (102-104) escape from danger is in
nearly the same terms expressed by the notion of overleaping
the net. In Euripides<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> this contrivance is called ἀρκύστατος μηχανὴ;
and in the <i>Agamemnon</i> of Seneca<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> the same allusion is introduced:</p>

<p>Part of the apparatus of a huntsman consisted in the stakes
which he drove into the ground to support his nets, and which
Antipater Sidonius thus describes:</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p> Καὶ πυρὶ θηγαλέους ὀξυπαγεῖς στάλικας;</p>

<p><i>i. e.</i> “The sharp stakes hardened in the fire<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span></p>

<p>The term which Xenophon uses of the stakes is, according
to some manuscripts of his work, σχαλίδες. He says, they
should be fixed so as to lean backwards, and thus more effectually
to resist the impulse of the animals rushing against
them<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. The Latin term answering to στάλικες was <span class="smcap">Vari</span>. We

<p>Gratius Faliscus, adopting a Greek term, calls them <i>ancones</i>,
on account of the “elbow” or fork at the top:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Hic magis in cervos valuit metus: ast ubi lentæ</div>

<p>It was the business of one of the attendants to watch the nets:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ego retia servo.&mdash;Virg. <i>Buc.</i> iii. 75.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes there was a watchman at each extremity and
one in the middle, as in the Persian lion-hunt<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>. The prevalence
of this method of hunting in Persia might be inferred
from the circumstance, that one of the chief employments of
the inhabitants consisted in making these nets (ἄρκυς, Strabo,
xv. 3. § 18). To watch the nets was called ἀρκυωρεῖν (Ælian, H.
A. i. 2), and the man who discharged this office ἀρκυωρὸς (Xen.,
<i>De Ven.</i> ii. 3; vi. 1.).</p>

<p>The paintings discovered in the catacombs of Egypt show,
that the ancient inhabitants of that country used nets for hunting
in the same manner which has now been shown to have

</div>

<p>Hunting-nets had much larger meshes than fishing or fowlers’-nets,
because in general a fish or a fowl could escape
through a much smaller opening than a quadruped. In hunting,
the important circumstance was to make the nets so strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
that the beasts could not break through them. The large
size of the meshes is denoted by the phrases “retia rara<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>” and
“raras plagas<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>;” and it is exhibited in a bas-relief in the collection
of ancient marbles at Ince-Blundell in Lancashire. See
<a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a> fig. 1. This sculpture presents the following circumstances,
which are worthy of notice as illustrative of the passages
above collected from ancient authors. Three servants
with staves carry a large net on their shoulders. The foremost
of them holds by a leash a dog, which is eager to engage in the
chase<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>. Then follows another scene in the hunt. A net with
very large meshes and five feet high is set up, being supported
by three stakes. Two boars and two deer are caught. A
watchman, holding a staff, stands at each end of the net. Fig.
2, <a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a> is taken from a bas-relief in the same collection,
representing a party returning from the chase, with the quadrupeds
which they have caught. Two men carry the net, holding
in their hands the stakes with forks at the top. These
bas-reliefs have been taken from sarcophagi erected in commemoration
of hunters, and they are engraved in the <i>Ancient
statues, &amp;c. at Ince-Blundell</i>, vol. ii. pl. 89 and 126. An excellent
representation of these forked staves is given in a sepulchral
bas-relief in Bartoli, <i>Admiranda</i>, tab. 70, which Mr.
Dansey has copied at p. 307 of his translation of Arrian <i>on
Coursing</i>, and which represents a party of hunters returning
from the chase. Another example of the <i>varus</i>, or forked staff,
is seen in a sepulchral stone lately found at York (England),
and engraved in Mr. Wellbeloved’s <i>Eburacum</i>, pl. 14. fig. 2.
The man, who holds the varus in his right hand, and who appears
to be a huntsman and a native of the north of England,
though partly clothed after the Roman fashion, wears an inner
and outer tunic, and over them a fringed sagum. In the <i>Sepolcri
de’ Nasoni</i>, published by Bartoli, there is a representation
of a lion-hunt, and of another in which deer are caught by
means of nets set up so as to inclose a large space. In Montfaucon’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
<i>Supplement</i>, tome iii., is an engraving from a bas-relief,
in which a net is represented: but none of these are so instructive
as the two bas-reliefs at Ince-Blundell.</p>

could not leap over them, is alluded to in the expression Ὕψος
κρεῖσσον ἐκπηδήματος, <i>i. e.</i> “a height too great for the animals <i>to leap
out</i><a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>.”</p>

<p>Xenophon, in his treatise <i>on Hunting</i>, gives various directions
respecting the making and setting of nets; and Schneider
has added to that treatise a dissertation concerning the ἄρκυς. It
is evident that this kind of net was made with a bag (κεκρύφαλος,
vi. 7), being the same which is now called the <i>purse-net</i>, or the
<i>tunnel-net</i>, and that the aim of the hunter was to drive the
animal into the bag; that the watchman (ἀρκυωρὸς) waited to see
it caught there; that branches of trees were placed in the bag
to keep it expanded, to render it invisible, and thus to decoy
quadrupeds into it; that a rope ran round the mouth of the bag
(περίδρομος, vi. 9), and was drawn tight by the impulse of the
animal rushing in so as to prevent its escape<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>. To this rope
was attached another, called ἐπίδρομος, which was used as follows.
In fig. 1. of <a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a> we observe, that the upper border of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
net consists of a very strong rope. Xenophon calls this σαρδὼν
(vi. 9). In the purse-net it was furnished with rings. The
 ἀρκυωρὸς, or watchman, lay in ambush, holding one end of the
 ἐπίδρομος, which ran through the rings, and was fastened at the
other end to the περίδρομος, so that by pulling it he drew the mouth
of the bag still more firm and close. He then went to the bag
and despatched the quadruped which it inclosed, or carried it
off alive, informing his companions of the capture by <i>shouting</i><a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_697" href="#FNanchor_697" class="label">[697]</a> This effect of the περίδρομος is well expressed by Seneca, “Arctatque motu
vincla:” also the circumstance of the branches used to distend the bag and to
make it invisible; “Fluentes undique et cæcos sinus.”</p>

<p>Homer (<i>Il.</i> v. 487) seems to allude to the same contrivance, and to apply the
term ἀχῖδες to the rope which encircled the entrance of the bag, with the others
attached to it.</p>

<p>We find in Brunck’s <i>Analecta</i> (ii. 10. No. xx.) the phrase ἀγκύλα δίκτυα applied
to hunting-nets. It was probably meant to designate the ἄρκυς, which might be
called ἀγκύλα, <i>i. e.</i> angular, because they were made like bags ending in a
point. The term νεφέλη, which occurs in Aristophanes (<i>Aves</i>, 195), and denoted
some contrivance for catching birds, is said by the Scholiast on the passage to
have meant a kind of hunting-net. But this explanation is evidently good for
nothing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_698" href="#FNanchor_698" class="label">[698]</a> Oppian, <i>Cyneg.</i> iv. 409. Pliny mentions these <i>epidromi</i>, or <i>running ropes</i>:

</div>
</div>

<p>In this treatise Xenophon distinguishes the nets used in
hunting by three different appellations; ἄρκυς, ἐνόδιον, and δίκτυον.
Oppian also distinguishes the δίκτυον used in hunting from the
 ἄρκυς<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>. The ἄρκυς or <i>cassis</i>, <i>i. e.</i> “the purse-or tunnel-net,” was
by much the most complicated in its formation. The ἐνόδιον, or
“road-net,” was comparatively small: it was placed across any
road, or path, to prevent the animals from pursuing that path:
it must have been used to stop the narrow openings between
bushes. The δίκτυον was a large net, simply intended to inclose
the ground: it therefore resembled in some measure the sean
used in fishing. The term, thus specially applied, may be
translated <i>a hay</i>, or <i>a hallier</i><a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>. These three kinds of nets
appear to be mentioned together by Nemesianus under the
names of <i>retia</i> (i. e. δίκτυα), <i>casses</i> (i. e. ἄρκυς), and <i>plagæ</i> (i. e.
 ἐνόδια.):</p>

<p>Xenophon, in his treatise on Hunting, further informs us, that
the cord used for making the ἄρκυς, or purse-net, consisted of three
strands, and that three lines twisted together commonly made
a strand (ii. 4); but that, when the net was intended to catch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
the wild boar, nine lines went to a strand instead of three
(x. 2).</p>

<p>It remains to be noticed, that, when the long range of nets, set
up in the manner which has been now represented, was designed
to catch the stag (<i>cervus</i>), it was flanked by cords, to which, as
well as to the nets themselves, feathers <i>dyed scarlet</i>, and of
other bright colors intermixed with their native white, and
sometimes probably birds’ wings, were tied so as to flare and
flutter in the wind<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>. This appendage to the nets was called
the <i>metus</i> or <i>formido</i> (Virg. <i>Æn.</i> xii. 750), because it frightened
these timid quadrupeds so as to urge them onwards into
the toils. Hence Virgil, speaking of the method of taking
stags in Scythia, says,</p>

<p>Fishing-nets<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> were of six different kinds, which are enumerated
by Oppian as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>
</div>

<p>Of these by far the most common were the ἀμφίβληστρον, or
<i>casting-net</i>, and the σαγήνη, <i>i. e.</i> the <i>drag</i> or <i>sean</i>. Consequently
these two are the only kinds mentioned by Virgil and
Ovid in the following passages:</p>

<p>By Virgil the casting-net is called <i>funda</i>, which is the common
term for a sling. In illustration of this it is to be observed,
that the casting-net is thrown over the fisherman’s shoulder,
and then whirled in the air much like a sling. By this action
he causes it to fly open at the bottom so as to form a circle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
which is loaded at intervals with stones or pieces of lead, and
this circle “strikes the broad river<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>:” for the casting-net is used
either in pools of moderate depth, or in rivers which have, like
pools, a broad smooth surface; whereas the sean is employed
for fishing in the deep (<i>pelago</i>)<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_703" href="#FNanchor_703" class="label">[703]</a> The Arabs now employ the casting-net on the shores of the Arabian Gulf.
“Its form is round, and loaded at the lower part with small pieces of lead; and,
when the fisherman approaches a shoal of fish, his art consists in throwing the
net so that it may expand itself in a circular form before it reaches the surface
of the water.”&mdash;Wellsted’s <i>Travels in Arabia</i>, vol. ii. p. 148.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_704" href="#FNanchor_704" class="label">[704]</a> For a technical account of nets, including the casting-net as now made, the

same subject in French.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Isidore of Seville, in his account of the different kinds of nets
(<i>Orig.</i> xix. 5), thus speaks: “<i>Funda</i> genus est piscatorii retis,

<i>jaculum</i> dicitur. Plautus:</p>

of the Garonne, appears to distinguish between the <i>jaculum</i> and the <i>funda</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the passage of Plautus, here quoted by Isidore, there
are two others, in which the casting-net is mentioned under
the name of <i>rete jaculum</i>, viz. <i>Asinar</i>. l. i. 87, and <i>Truc.</i> l. i.
14. Pareus, as we find from his <i>Lexicon Plautinum</i>, clearly
understood the meaning of the term, and the distinction between
the casting-net and the sean. Of the <i>Rete jaculum</i> he
says, “Sic dicitur ad differentiam <i>verriculi</i>, quod non jacitur,
sed trahitur et verritur.” He adds, that Herodotus calls it
 ἀμφίβληστρον, and the Germans <i>Wurffgarn</i>.</p>

<p>The word occurs twice in Herodotus, and both places throw
light upon its meaning. In Book i. c. 141. he says: “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
Lydians had no sooner been brought into subjection by the
Persians than the Ionians and Æolians sent ambassadors to
Cyrus at Sardis, entreating him to receive them under his dominion
on the same conditions on which they had been under
Crœsus. To this proposal he replied in the following fable. A
piper, having seen some fishes in the sea, <i>played for a while
on his pipe, thinking that this would make them come to
him on the land</i>. Perceiving the fallacy of this expectation,
he took a casting-net, and, having thrown it around a great
number of the fishes, he drew them out of the water. He
then said to the fishes, as they were jumping about, <i>As you did
not choose to dance out of the water, when I played to you on
my pipe, you may put a stop to your dancing now</i>.” The
other passage (ii. 95) has been illustrated in a very successful
manner by William Spence, Esq., F. R. S., in a paper in the
Transactions of the Entomological Society for the year 1834.
In connection with the curious fact, that the common house-fly
will not in general pass through the meshes of a net, Mr.
Spence produces this passage, in which Herodotus states, that
the fishermen who lived about the marshes of Egypt, being
each in possession of a casting-net, and using it in the day-time
to catch fishes, employed these nets in the night to keep
off the gnats, by which that country is infested. The casting-net
was fixed so as to encircle the bed, on which the fisherman
slept; and, as this kind of net is always pear-shaped, or of a
conical form, it is evident that nothing could be better adapted
to the purpose, as it would be suspended like a tent over the
body of its owner. In this passage Herodotus twice uses the
term ἀμφίβληστρον, and once he calls the same thing δίκτυον, because,
as we have seen, this was a common term applicable to nets of
every description<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_706" href="#FNanchor_706" class="label">[706]</a> <i>None of the commentators appear to have understood these passages.</i> In
particular we find that Schweighäuser in his <i>Lexicon Herodoteum</i> explains
 Ἀμφίβληστρον thus: “Verriculum, Rete quod circumjicitur.” <i>Rete</i>, however,
corresponds to δίκτυον, which meant a net of any kind; and <i>Verriculum</i> is the
Latin for Σαγήνη, which, as will be shown hereafter, was a sean, or drag-net.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The antiquity of the casting-net among the Greeks appears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
from a passage in the <i>Shield of Hercules</i>, attributed to Hesiod
(l. 213-215). The poet says, that the shield represented the sea
with fishes seen in the water, “and on the rocks sat a fisherman
watching, and he held in his hands a casting-net (ἀμφίβληστρον)
for fishes, and seemed to be throwing it from him.” We apprehend
that, the position of <i>sitting</i> was not so suitable to the use
of the casting-net as standing, because it requires the free use
of the arms, which a man cannot well have when he sits. In
other respects this description exactly agrees with the use of the
casting-net: for it is thrown by a single person, who remains on
land at the edge of the water, observes the fishes in it, and
throws the net from him into the water so as suddenly to inclose
them.</p>

<p>In two of the tragedies of Æschylus we find the term ἀμφίβληστρον
applied <i>figuratively</i> by Clytemnestra to the <i>shawl</i>, in which
she enveloped her husband in order to murder him.</p>

The following curious passage of Meletius <i>de Natura Hominis</i>,
in which that author, probably following Galen, describes
the expansion of the optic nerves, mentions the casting-net as
“an instrument used by fishermen”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Διασχίζονται δὲ τὰ νεῦρα εἰς τοὺς θαλάμους, ὥσπερ ἤν τις λαβὼν πάπυρον, ταύτην εἰς
λεπτὰ διατεμὼν καὶ διασχίζων ἀναπλέκηται πάλιν, καὶ ποιῇ χιτῶνα λεγόμενον ἀμφιβληστροειδῆ,

</div>

<p>The χιτὼν ἀμφιβληστροειδὴς, or <i>tunica retina</i>, was so called on
account of its resemblance in form to the casting-net.</p>

<p>As we learn from Herodotus that the casting-net was universally
employed by the fishermen of Egypt, we shall not be
surprised to find it mentioned in the Alexandrine, or, as it is
commonly called, the Septuagint version of the Psalms and
Prophets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The word in the original Hebrew is מכמור, which Gesenius
translates “Rete,” <i>a net</i>. This word must have been more
general in its meaning than the Greek ἀμφίβληστρον, and included
the purse-net, or ἄρκυς. The Chaldee and Syriac versions use in
this passage a word, which denotes <i>snares</i> in general. See
<i>Isaiah</i> li. 20, where the same word is used in the Hebrew, but
applied to the catching of a quadruped, and where consequently
the purse-net must have been intended.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.”&mdash;<i>Common English

</div>

<p>It is to be observed, that this prophecy relates to Egypt. The
Hebrew verb פרש, here translated “<i>expandentes</i>,” “<i>they that
spread</i>,” is exactly applicable to the remarkable expansion of
the casting-net just as it reaches the surface of the water. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
the Alexandrine version we may also observe the clear distinction
between the two principal kinds of nets, the sean and the
casting-net, and that the man who fishes with the latter is called
 ἀμφιβολεὺς, as in Latin he was designated by the single term
<i>jaculator</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p> Εἵλκυσεν αὐτὸν ἐν ἀμφιβλήστρῳ, καὶ συνήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἐν ταῖς σαγήναις αὐτοῦ· ἕνεκεν τοὺτου
εὐφρανθήσεται καὶ χαρήσεται ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ. Ἕνεκεν τούτου θύσει τῇ σαγήνῃ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
θυμιάσει τῷ ἀμφιβλήστρῳ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐλίπανε μερίδα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ βρώματα αὐτοῦ
ἐκλεκτά. Διὰ τοῦτο ἀμφιβαλεῖ τὸ ἀμφίβληστρον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διαπαντὸς ἀποκτένειν ἔθνη οὐ

<p><i>i. e.</i> “He (the Chaldean) hath drawn him in a casting-net and gathered him
in his seans: therefore his heart shall rejoice and be glad. Therefore he shall
sacrifice to his sean and burn incense to his casting-net, because by them he hath
fattened his portion and his chosen dainties. Therefore he shall throw his casting-net,
and not spare utterly to slay nations.”&mdash;<i>Habakkuk</i>, i. 15-17.</p>

<p>“They catch them in their net and gather them in their drag; therefore they
rejoice and are glad. Therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense
unto their drag: because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteous.
Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?”&mdash;<i>Common
English Version.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Latin Vulgate in this passage uses without discrimination
the terms <i>rete</i> and <i>sagena</i>, which latter is the Greek word
in a Latin form.</p>

<p> Ἀμφίβληστρον occurs twice in the New Testament. Matthew
iv. 18: “Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
Simon and Andrew, <i>casting a net into the sea</i>; for they were
fishers”: in the original, βάλλοντας ἀμφίβληστρον εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν; in the
Vulgate version, “mittentes rete.” It appears no sufficient
objection to the sense which has been assigned to ἀμφίβληστρον,
that here two persons are mentioned as using it at the same
time. Being partners and engaged in the same employment,
one perhaps collecting the fishes which the other caught, they
might be described together as “throwing the casting-net,”
although only one at a time held it in his hands. In other
respects this explanation is particularly suitable to the circumstances.
Jesus was walking on the shore and accosted the
two brothers. This suits the supposition that they were on the
shore likewise, and not fishing out of a boat, as they did with
the sean at other times. In verse 20 the Evangelist uses the
term δίκτυα (nets), saying “they left their nets,” and meaning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
both their casting-net and those of other kinds. In verse 21
he mentions that James and John were in their boat, mending
their nets (δίκτυα).</p>

<p>The same things are to be observed in Mark i. 16, which is
the parallel passage.</p>

<h4>IV.<br />
 ΓΡΙΦΟΣ, <i>or</i> ΓΡΙΠΟΣ.
</h4>

<p>Pursuing the order adopted by Oppian in his list of fishing
nets above quoted, we come to the Γρῖφος. What kind of net
this was we have been unable to discover. It must, however,
have been one of the most useful and important kinds, because
Plutarch mentions γρίφοι καὶ σαγήναι as the common implements of
the fisherman<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>, and Artemidorus speaks of this together with
the casting-net and the sean in similar terms<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>.</p>

apparently equivalent to ἁλιεὺς<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>. We also find the expression

<h4>V.<br />
 ΓΑΓΓΑΜΟΝ.</h4>

<p>The third fishing-net in Oppian’s enumeration is Γάγγαμον.
We find it once mentioned metaphorically, viz. by Æschylus,
who calls an inextricable calamity, Γάγγαμον ἄτης<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>. In Schneider’s
edition of Oppian we find this note, “Rete ostreis capiendis
esse annotavit Hesychius.” Passow also in his Lexicon explains
it as “a small round net for catching oysters.” The reference
to Hesychius is incorrect. If it was a net for catching oysters,
which appears very doubtful, it may have been the net used by
the Indians in the pearl-fishery<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>.</p>

<h4>VI.<br />
 ὙΠΟΧΗ.</h4>

<p>The ὑποχὴ, which is the fourth in Oppian’s enumeration, was
the landing-net, used merely to take fishes out of the water
when they rose to the surface, or in similar circumstances to
which it was adapted. It was made with a hoop (κύκλος) fastened
to a pole, and was perhaps also provided with the means of
closing the round aperture at the top<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>.</p>

<h4>VII.<br />
TRAGUM, TRAGULA, VERRICULUM.<br />
 ΣΑΓΗΝΗ.</h4>

<p>These were the Greek and Latin names for the <i>sean</i>.
Before producing the passages in which they occur, we will
present to the reader an account of this kind of net as now
used by the fishermen on the coast of Cornwall (England) for
catching pilchards, and as described by Dr. Paris in his elegant
and pleasant <i>Guide to Mount’s Bay and Land’s End</i><a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>.</p>

<p>“At the proper season men are stationed on the cliffs to
observe by the color of the water where the shoals of pilchards
are to be found. The sean is carried out in a boat, and thrown
into the sea by two men with such dexterity, that in less than
four minutes the fish are inclosed. It is then either moored, or,
where the shore is sandy and shelving, it is drawn into more
shallow water. After this the fish are bailed into boats and
carried to shore. A <i>sean</i> is frequently <i>three hundred fathoms
long, and seventeen deep</i>. The bottom of the net is kept to
the ground by leaden weights, whilst the corks keep the top of
it floating on the surface. A sean has been known to inclose
at one time as many as <i>twelve hundred hogsheads</i>, amounting
to about <i>three millions of fish</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
Let this passage be compared with the following, which gives
an account of the use of the same kind of net among the
Arabs. It will then appear how extensively it is employed,
since we find it used in exactly the same way both by our own
countrymen and by tribes which we consider as ranking very
low in the scale of civilization; and on making this comparison,
the inference will seem not unreasonable, that the ancient
Greeks and Romans, who in several of their colonies in the
Euxine Sea, on the coasts of Ionia, and of Spain, and in other
places, carried on the catching and curing of fish with the
greatest possible activity and to a wonderful extent, used nets of
as great a compass as those which are here described.</p>

<p>“The fishery is here (<i>i. e.</i> at Burka, on the eastern coast of
Arabia) conducted on a grand scale, by means of nets many
hundred fathoms in length, which are carried out by boats.
The upper part is supported by small blocks of wood, formed
from the light and buoyant branches of the <i>date-palm</i>, while
the lower part is loaded with lead. To either extremity of this
a rope is attached, by which, when the whole of the net is laid
out, about thirty or forty men drag it towards the shore. The
quantity thus secured is enormous; and what they do not require
for their own consumption is salted and carried into the
interior. When, as is very generally the case, the nets <i>are the
common property of the whole village</i>, they divide the produce
into equal shares<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>.”</p>

<p>That this method of fishing was practised by the Egyptians
from a remote antiquity appears from the remaining monuments.
The paintings on the tombs show persons engaged in
drawing the sean, which has floats along its upper margin and
leads along the lower border<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>. An ancient Egyptian net, obtained
by M. Passalacqua, is preserved in the Museum at Berlin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
Some of its leads and floats remain, as well as a gourd,
which assisted the floats<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>.</p>

drawing the net to land full of fishes. There are eight floats along the top, and
four leads at the bottom on each side. The water is drawn as is usual in Egyptian

<p>Besides the verses of Oppian, which are above quoted, we
find another passage of the same poem (<i>Hal.</i> iii. 82, 83),
which mentions the following appendages to the σαγήνη, viz. the
 πέζαι, the σφαιρῶνες, and the σκολιὸς πάναγρος. As the πόδες, or <i>feet</i> of a
sail were the ropes fastened to its lower corners, we may conclude
that the πέζαι were the ropes attached to the corners of the
sean, and used in a similar manner to fasten it to the shore and
to draw it in to the land, as is described by Ovid in the line
already quoted,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hos cava <i>contento</i> retia <i>fune</i> trahunt.</p>
</div>

<p>The σφαιρῶνες, as the name implies, were spherical, and must
therefore have been either the floats of wood or cork at the top,
or the weights, consisting either of round stones or pieces of
lead, at the bottom. The σκολιὸς πάναγρος must have been a kind
of bag formed in the sean to receive the fishes, and thus corresponding
to the purse or conical bag in the ἄρκυς. The term
is illustrated by the application of the equivalent epithet ἀγκύλα
or “angular,” to hunting-nets in a passage from Brunck’s <i>Analecta</i>,
which was formerly explained, and by the epithet “cava”
in the line just quoted from Ovid<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>.</p>

<p>In the following passage Ovid mentions the use both of the
corks and of the leads<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>. This passage also shows that several
nets were fastened together in order to form a long sean:</p>

<p>This use of cork and lead in fishing is also mentioned by
Ælian, <i>Hist. Anim.</i> xii. 43; and that of cork by Pausanias,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
viii. 12. § 1; and by Pliny, H. N. xvi. 8. s. 13, where, in reciting
the various uses of cork, he says it was employed “piscantium
tragulis.” Sidonius Apollinaris, describing his own
villa, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hinc jam spectabis, ut promoveat alnum piscator in pelagus, ut stataria retia
suberinis corticibus extendat.&mdash;<i>Epist.</i> ii. 2.</p>

<p>“Hence you will see how the fisherman moves forward his boat into the deep
water, that he may extend his stationary nets by means of corks.”</p>
</div>

<p>Alciphron, in his account of a fishing excursion near the
Promontory of Phalerum, says, “The draught of fishes was
so great as almost to submerge the corks<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>.” The earnest desire
of a posterity, founded on the wish for posthumous remembrance,
which was a very strong and prevailing sentiment
among the ancients, is illustrated by the language of Electra
in the Choëphorœ of Æschylus, where she entreats her father
upon this consideration to attend to her prayer, and likens his
memory to a net, which his children, like corks, would save
from disappearing:&mdash;“<i>Do not extinguish the race of the Pelopidæ.
For thus you will live after you are dead. For a
man’s children are the preservers of his fame when dead,
and, like corks in dragging the net, they save the flaxen
string from the abyss.</i>” The use of the corks is mentioned
in several of the epigrams of the Greek Anthology, already referred
to, and in the following passage of Plutarch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Passages have been already produced from Plutarch, Artemidorus,
and the Alexandrine version of Isaiah and Habakkuk,
in which the sean is mentioned by its Greek name σαγήνη, in
contradistinction to other kinds of nets. Also the passage
above cited from Virgil’s Georgics (“pelagoque alius trahit humida
lina”), indicates the use of the sean in deep water, and
the practice of dragging it out of the water by means of ropes,
which gave origin both to its English name, <i>the Drag-net</i>,
and to its Latin appellations, <i>tragula</i>, used by Pliny (<i>l. c.</i>),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
and <i>tragum</i>, which is found in the ancient Glossaries and in
Isidore of Seville<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>.</p>

<p>The Latin name <i>verriculum</i> occurs in a passage of Valerius Maximus, which
is also remarkable for a reference to the Ionian fisheries, and for the use of the
word <i>jactus</i>, literally, <i>a throw</i>, corresponding to that which the Cornish men denominate,
<i>a hawl of fish</i>.</p>

<p>A piscatoribus in Milesia regione verriculum trahentibus quidam jactum emerat.&mdash;<i>Memor.</i>

<p>We introduce here an expression of Philo, in which we may remark that βόλος
ἰχθύων corresponds exactly to <i>jactus</i> in Latin, and that the drawing of the net
into a circle is clearly indicated: βόλον ἰχθύων πάντας ἐν κύκλῳ σαγηνεύσας.&mdash;<i>Vita

<p>We find mention of the sean more especially for the capture
of the tunny and of the pelamys, which were the two principal
kinds of fish caught in the Mediterranean. Lucian speaks
of the tunny-sean<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>, which was probably the largest net of the
kind, and he relates the circumstance of a tunny escaping from
its bag or bosom<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>. The sean is thrice mentioned in the Epistles
of Alciphron (<i>l. c.</i> and lib. i. epp. 17, 18.), and in the two latter
passages, as used for catching tunnies and pelamides. We
read also of a dolphin (δελφὶς) approaching the sean<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>; but this
might be by accident. It was not, we apprehend, employed to
catch dolphins.</p>

</div>

<p>In the following passage of the Odyssey (xxii. 384-387) we
have a description of the use of a sean in a small bay, having
a sandy shore at its extremity, and consequently most suitable
for the employment of this kind of net:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet here compares Penelope’s suitors, who lie slain upon
the ground, to fishes, “which the fishermen by means of a net
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
full of holes have drawn out of the hoary sea to a hollow bay,
and all of which, deprived of the waves of the sea, are poured
upon the sands.” Although the general term δίκτυον is here
used, it is evident that the net intended was the sean, or dragnet.</p>

<p>In one of the passages of Alciphron already referred to,
mention is made of the use of the sean in a similar situation.
Some persons, who are fishing in a bay for tunnies and pelamides,
inclose nearly the whole bay with their sean, expecting
to catch a very large quantity<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>. This circumstance proves, that
the sean was used with the ancient Greeks, as it is with us, to
encompass a great extent of water.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_728" href="#FNanchor_728" class="label">[728]</a> Τῇ σαγῆνῃ μονονουχί τὸν κόλπον ὅλον περιελάβομεν.&mdash;<i>Epist.</i> i. 17.</p>

<p>A few miscellaneous passages, which refer to the use of the sean, may be conveniently
introduced here:</p>

<p>Diogenes, seeing a great number of fishes in the deep, says there is need of a
sean to catch them; σαγήνης δέησις.&mdash;Lucian, <i>Piscata</i>, § 51. tom. i. p. 618, ed.
Reitz.</p>

<p>The sean is called, from its material, σαγηναίον λίνον, in an epigram of Archias.&mdash;Brunck,
<i>Anal.</i> ii. 94. No. 10.</p>

<p>Plutarch, describing the <i>spider’s web</i>, says, that its <i>weaving</i> is like the labor
<i>of women at the loom</i>, its hunting like that of fishermen with the sean.&mdash;<i>De Solertia
Animalium</i>, tom. x. p. 29, ed. Reiske. He here uses the term σαγηνευτὴς
for <i>a fisher with the sean</i>. This verbal noun is regularly formed from σαγηνεύειν,
which means <i>to inclose or catch with the sean</i>: e. g. ἐν δίκτυοις σεσαγηνευμένοι.&mdash;Herodian,
iv. 9, 12.</p>

<p>Lucian uses the same verb in reference to the story of Vulcan inclosing Mars
and Venus in a net; σαγηνεύει τοῖς δεσμοῖς.&mdash;<i>Dialogi Deor.</i> tom. i. p. 243. <i>Somnium</i>,
tom. ii. p. 707, ed. Reitz.</p>

<p>Leonidas of Tarentum, in an epigram enumerating the ornaments of a lady’s
toilet (Brunck, <i>Anal.</i> i. p. 221), mentions ὁ πλατὺς τριχῶν σαγηνευτήρ</p>. Jacobs
(<i>Annot. in Anthol.</i> i. 2. p. 63) supposes this to mean the lady’s comb; but,
judging from the known meaning of σαγήνη and its derivatives, we may conclude that
it was the κεκρύφαλος, or net, which inclosed and encircled the hair, like a sean.

<p>The following verse of Manilius (lib. v. ver. 678.) is remarkable as a rare instance
of the adoption of the Greek word <i>sagena</i> by a Latin poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Excipitur vasta circumvallata sagena.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have seen that the sean supplied figures of speech no less
than the purse-net (ἄρκυς), and the casting-net (ἀμφίβληστρον). It is
applied thus in the case of persons who are ensnared by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
wicked<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>, who are captivated by the charms of love<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> or of eloquence<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>,
or who are held in bondage by superstition<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>. But
by far the most distinct, expressive and important of its metaphorical
applications, was to the mode of besieging a city by
encircling it with one uninterrupted line of soldiers, or sweeping
away the entire population of a certain district by marching in
similar order across it. Of this the first example occurs in
Herodotus iii. 145:&mdash;</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_732" href="#FNanchor_732" class="label">[732]</a> Plutarch, evidently referring to the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, says, “The
Jews on the Sabbath sitting down on coarse blankets (ἐν ἀγνάμπτοις, literally, in
 ἱμάτια, or blankets, which had not been fulled, or cleansed by the γναφεύς), even
when the enemy were setting the ladders to scale the walls, did not rise up, but

<p>As we speak of <i>dragging</i> a pit, so the Greeks would have
spoken, in this metaphorical sense, of <i>dragging</i> an island.
In the sixth book (ch. xxxi.) Herodotus particularly describes
this method of capturing the enemy. According to this account
the Persians landed on the northern side of the island. They
then took hold of one another’s hands so as to form a long line,
and thus linked together they walked across the island to the
south side, so as to hunt out all the inhabitants. The historian
here particularly mentions, that Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos
were reduced to captivity in this manner. It is recorded by
Plato<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>, that Datis, in order to alarm the Athenians, against
whom he was advancing at the head of the Persian army,
spread a report that his soldiers, joining hand to hand, had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
taken all the Eretrians captive as in a sean. The reader is
referred to the Notes of Wesseling and Valckenaer on Herod.
iii. 149 for some passages, in which subsequent Greek authors
have quoted Herodotus and Plato. We find σαγηνευθῆναι, “to be
dragged,” used in the same manner by Heliodorus<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>.</p>

  </div>

</div>

<p>In addition to the passages of Isaiah and Habakkuk which
mention the drag in opposition to the casting-net; we find three
references to the use of it in the prophecies of Ezekiel, viz. in
Ezek. xxvi. 5. 14; xlvii. 10. The prophet, foretelling the
destruction of Tyre, says it would become <i>a place to dry seans
upon</i>, ψυγμὸς σαγηνῶν; “siccatio sagenarum,” <i>Vulgate Version</i>;
“a place for the spreading of nets,” <i>Common English Version</i>.
The Hebrew term for a drag or sean is here חרם.</p>

<p>The only passage of the New Testament which makes
express mention of the sean, is Matt. xiii. 47, 48: “The kingdom
of heaven is like unto a net (σαγήνη) that was cast into the
sea, and gathered of every kind; which, when it was full, they
drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels,
but cast the bad away.” The casting-net, which can only
inclose part of a very small shoal, would not have been adapted
to the object of this parable. But we perceive the allusion
intended by it to the great quantity and variety of fishes of
every kind which are brought to the shore of the bay (αἰγιαλὸν)
by the use of the drag. The Vulgate here retains the Greek
word, translating <i>sagena</i> as in the above-cited passages of
Habakkuk and Ezekiel. In John xxi. 6. 8. 11, the use of the
sean is evidently intended to be described, although it is called
four times by the common term δίκτυον, which denoted either a
sean, or a net of any other kind. It is in this passage translated
<i>rete</i> in the Latin Vulgate.</p>

<p>The Greek σαγήνη having been adopted under the form <i>sagena</i>
in the Latin Vulgate, this was changed into rezne by the Anglo-Saxons<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>,
and their descendants, have still further abridged it
into <i>sean</i>. In the south of England this word is also pronounced
and spelt <i>seine</i>, as it is in French. We find in Bede’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
Ecclesiastical History<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> a curious passage on the introduction of
this kind of net into England. He says, “the people had as
yet only learnt to catch eels with nets. Wilfrid caused them to
collect together all their eel-nets, and to use them as a sean for
catching fishes of all kinds.”</p>

<h4>VIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Reticulus</span> or <span class="smcap">Reticulum</span>.<br />
 ΓΥΡΓΑΘΟΣ.
</h4>

<p>In the ancient Glossaries we find Γύργαθος translated <i>Reticulus</i>
and <i>Reticulum</i>: it meant, therefore, <i>a small net</i>. It was not
a name for nets in general, nor did it denote any kind of hunting-net
or fishing-net, although the net indicated by this term
might be used occasionally for catching animals as well as for
other purposes. It was used, for example, in an island on the
coast of India to catch tortoises, being set at the mouths of the
caverns, which were the resort of those creatures<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>. But the
same term is applied to the nets which were used to carry
pebbles and stones intended to be thrown from military engines<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>;
and a similar contrivance was in common use for carrying
loaves of bread<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>. Hence it is manifest that the γύργαθος was
often much like the nets in which the Jewish boys in our streets
carry lemons, being inclosed at the mouth by a running string
or noose. We may therefore translate γύργαθος, “a bag-net,” as
it was made in the form of a bag. “To blow into a bag-net,”
 εἰς γύργαθον φυσᾷν, became a proverb, meaning to labor in vain.
But this bag was often of much smaller dimensions, and of
much finer materials, than in the instances already mentioned.
From a passage of Æneas Tacticus (p. 54. ed. Orell.) we may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
infer that it was sometimes not larger than a purse for the
pocket. Hence Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> properly applies the term γύργαθος to
the small spherical or oval bag in which spiders deposit their
eggs. Among the luxurious habits of the Sicilian prætor Verres,
it is recorded, that he had a small and very fine linen net, filled
with rose-leaves, “which ever and anon he gave his nose<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>.”
This net was, no doubt, called γύργαθος in Greek.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
